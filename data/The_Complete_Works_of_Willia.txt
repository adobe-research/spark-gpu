 The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so. To be sure you have an up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes in the first week of the next month. Since our ftp program has a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more or less.

 Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. This projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2 million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text files per month: thus upping our productivity from one million. The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by the December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion] This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end of the year 2001.

 THE SONNETS

 by William Shakespeare

 1

 From fairest creatures we desire increase,

 That thereby beauty's rose might never die,

 But as the riper should by time decease,

 His tender heir might bear his memory:

 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,

 Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,

 Making a famine where abundance lies,

 Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,

 And only herald to the gaudy spring,

 Within thine own bud buriest thy content,

 And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:

 Pity the world, or else this glutton be,

 To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

 2

 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,

 And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

 Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,

 Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:

 Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,

 Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;

 To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,

 Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.

 How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,

 If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine

 Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'

 Proving his beauty by succession thine.

 This were to be new made when thou art old,

 And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

 3

 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,

 Now is the time that face should form another,

 Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,

 Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.

 For where is she so fair whose uneared womb

 Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?

 Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,

 Of his self-love to stop posterity?

 Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee

 Calls back the lovely April of her prime,

 So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,

 Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.

 But if thou live remembered not to be,

 Die single and thine image dies with thee.

 4

 Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,

 Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?

 Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,

 And being frank she lends to those are free:

 Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,

 The bounteous largess given thee to give?

 Profitless usurer why dost thou use

 So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?

 For having traffic with thy self alone,

 Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,

 Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,

 What acceptable audit canst thou leave?

 Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,

 Which used lives th' executor to be.

 5

 Those hours that with gentle work did frame

 The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell

 Will play the tyrants to the very same,

 And that unfair which fairly doth excel:

 For never-resting time leads summer on

 To hideous winter and confounds him there,

 Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,

 Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:

 Then were not summer's distillation left

 A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,

 Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,

 Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.

 But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,

 Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.

 6

 Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,

 In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:

 Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,

 With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:

 That use is not forbidden usury,

 Which happies those that pay the willing loan;

 That's for thy self to breed another thee,

 Or ten times happier be it ten for one,

 Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,

 If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:

 Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,

 Leaving thee living in posterity?

 Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,

 To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.

 7

 Lo in the orient when the gracious light

 Lifts up his burning head, each under eye

 Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,

 Serving with looks his sacred majesty,

 And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,

 Resembling strong youth in his middle age,

 Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,

 Attending on his golden pilgrimage:

 But when from highmost pitch with weary car,

 Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,

 The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are

 From his low tract and look another way:

 So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:

 Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.

 8

 Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?

 Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:

 Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,

 Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?

 If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,

 By unions married do offend thine ear,

 They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds

 In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:

 Mark how one string sweet husband to another,

 Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;

 Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,

 Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:

 Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,

 Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.

 9

 Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,

 That thou consum'st thy self in single life?

 Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,

 The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,

 The world will be thy widow and still weep,

 That thou no form of thee hast left behind,

 When every private widow well may keep,

 By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:

 Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend

 Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;

 But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,

 And kept unused the user so destroys it:

 No love toward others in that bosom sits

 That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.

 10

 For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any

 Who for thy self art so unprovident.

 Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,

 But that thou none lov'st is most evident:

 For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,

 That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,

 Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate

 Which to repair should be thy chief desire:

 O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,

 Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?

 Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,

 Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,

 Make thee another self for love of me,

 That beauty still may live in thine or thee.

 11

 As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,

 In one of thine, from that which thou departest,

 And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,

 Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,

 Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,

 Without this folly, age, and cold decay,

 If all were minded so, the times should cease,

 And threescore year would make the world away:

 Let those whom nature hath not made for store,

 Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:

 Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;

 Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:

 She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,

 Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.

 12

 When I do count the clock that tells the time,

 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,

 When I behold the violet past prime,

 And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:

 When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,

 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd

 And summer's green all girded up in sheaves

 Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:

 Then of thy beauty do I question make

 That thou among the wastes of time must go,

 Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,

 And die as fast as they see others grow,

 And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence

 Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.

 13

 O that you were your self, but love you are

 No longer yours, than you your self here live,

 Against this coming end you should prepare,

 And your sweet semblance to some other give.

 So should that beauty which you hold in lease

 Find no determination, then you were

 Your self again after your self's decease,

 When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.

 Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,

 Which husbandry in honour might uphold,

 Against the stormy gusts of winter's day

 And barren rage of death's eternal cold?

 O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,

 You had a father, let your son say so.

 14

 Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,

 And yet methinks I have astronomy,

 But not to tell of good, or evil luck,

 Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,

 Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;

 Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,

 Or say with princes if it shall go well

 By oft predict that I in heaven find.

 But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,

 And constant stars in them I read such art

 As truth and beauty shall together thrive

 If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:

 Or else of thee this I prognosticate,

 Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.

 15

 When I consider every thing that grows

 Holds in perfection but a little moment.

 That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows

 Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.

 When I perceive that men as plants increase,

 Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:

 Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,

 And wear their brave state out of memory.

 Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,

 Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,

 Where wasteful time debateth with decay

 To change your day of youth to sullied night,

 And all in war with Time for love of you,

 As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

 16

 But wherefore do not you a mightier way

 Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?

 And fortify your self in your decay

 With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?

 Now stand you on the top of happy hours,

 And many maiden gardens yet unset,

 With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,

 Much liker than your painted counterfeit:

 So should the lines of life that life repair

 Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen

 Neither in inward worth nor outward fair

 Can make you live your self in eyes of men.

 To give away your self, keeps your self still,

 And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.

 17

 Who will believe my verse in time to come

 If it were filled with your most high deserts?

 Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb

 Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:

 If I could write the beauty of your eyes,

 And in fresh numbers number all your graces,

 The age to come would say this poet lies,

 Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.

 So should my papers (yellowed with their age)

 Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,

 And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,

 And stretched metre of an antique song.

 But were some child of yours alive that time,

 You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.

 18

 Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

 Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

 And summer's lease hath all too short a date:

 Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

 And often is his gold complexion dimmed,

 And every fair from fair sometime declines,

 By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:

 But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

 Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,

 Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,

 When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,

 So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

 19

 Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,

 And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,

 Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,

 And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,

 Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,

 And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time

 To the wide world and all her fading sweets:

 But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,

 O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,

 Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,

 Him in thy course untainted do allow,

 For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.

 Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,

 My love shall in my verse ever live young.

 20

 A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,

 Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,

 A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted

 With shifting change as is false women's fashion,

 An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:

 Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,

 A man in hue all hues in his controlling,

 Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.

 And for a woman wert thou first created,

 Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,

 And by addition me of thee defeated,

 By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.

 But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,

 Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

 21

 So is it not with me as with that muse,

 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,

 Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,

 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,

 Making a couplement of proud compare

 With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:

 With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,

 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.

 O let me true in love but truly write,

 And then believe me, my love is as fair,

 As any mother's child, though not so bright

 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:

 Let them say more that like of hearsay well,

 I will not praise that purpose not to sell.

 22

 My glass shall not persuade me I am old,

 So long as youth and thou are of one date,

 But when in thee time's furrows I behold,

 Then look I death my days should expiate.

 For all that beauty that doth cover thee,

 Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,

 Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,

 How can I then be elder than thou art?

 O therefore love be of thyself so wary,

 As I not for my self, but for thee will,

 Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary

 As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.

 Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,

 Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.

 23

 As an unperfect actor on the stage,

 Who with his fear is put beside his part,

 Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,

 Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;

 So I for fear of trust, forget to say,

 The perfect ceremony of love's rite,

 And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,

 O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:

 O let my looks be then the eloquence,

 And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,

 Who plead for love, and look for recompense,

 More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.

 O learn to read what silent love hath writ,

 To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.

 24

 Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,

 Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,

 My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,

 And perspective it is best painter's art.

 For through the painter must you see his skill,

 To find where your true image pictured lies,

 Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,

 That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:

 Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,

 Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me

 Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun

 Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;

 Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,

 They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

 25

 Let those who are in favour with their stars,

 Of public honour and proud titles boast,

 Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars

 Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;

 Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,

 But as the marigold at the sun's eye,

 And in themselves their pride lies buried,

 For at a frown they in their glory die.

 The painful warrior famoused for fight,

 After a thousand victories once foiled,

 Is from the book of honour razed quite,

 And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:

 Then happy I that love and am beloved

 Where I may not remove nor be removed.

 26

 Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage

 Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;

 To thee I send this written embassage

 To witness duty, not to show my wit.

 Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine

 May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;

 But that I hope some good conceit of thine

 In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:

 Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,

 Points on me graciously with fair aspect,

 And puts apparel on my tattered loving,

 To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,

 Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,

 Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.

 27

 Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,

 The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,

 But then begins a journey in my head

 To work my mind, when body's work's expired.

 For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)

 Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,

 And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,

 Looking on darkness which the blind do see.

 Save that my soul's imaginary sight

 Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,

 Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)

 Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.

 Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,

 For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.

 28

 How can I then return in happy plight

 That am debarred the benefit of rest?

 When day's oppression is not eased by night,

 But day by night and night by day oppressed.

 And each (though enemies to either's reign)

 Do in consent shake hands to torture me,

 The one by toil, the other to complain

 How far I toil, still farther off from thee.

 I tell the day to please him thou art bright,

 And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:

 So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,

 When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.

 But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,

 And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger

 29

 When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,

 I all alone beweep my outcast state,

 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,

 And look upon my self and curse my fate,

 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,

 Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,

 Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,

 With what I most enjoy contented least,

 Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,

 Haply I think on thee, and then my state,

 (Like to the lark at break of day arising

 From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,

 For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,

 That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

 30

 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,

 I summon up remembrance of things past,

 I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,

 And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:

 Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)

 For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,

 And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,

 And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.

 Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,

 And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er

 The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,

 Which I new pay as if not paid before.

 But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)

 All losses are restored, and sorrows end.

 31

 Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,

 Which I by lacking have supposed dead,

 And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,

 And all those friends which I thought buried.

 How many a holy and obsequious tear

 Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,

 As interest of the dead, which now appear,

 But things removed that hidden in thee lie.

 Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,

 Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,

 Who all their parts of me to thee did give,

 That due of many, now is thine alone.

 Their images I loved, I view in thee,

 And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.

 32

 If thou survive my well-contented day,

 When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover

 And shalt by fortune once more re-survey

 These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:

 Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,

 And though they be outstripped by every pen,

 Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,

 Exceeded by the height of happier men.

 O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,

 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,

 A dearer birth than this his love had brought

 To march in ranks of better equipage:

 But since he died and poets better prove,

 Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.

 33

 Full many a glorious morning have I seen,

 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,

 Kissing with golden face the meadows green;

 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:

 Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,

 With ugly rack on his celestial face,

 And from the forlorn world his visage hide

 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:

 Even so my sun one early morn did shine,

 With all triumphant splendour on my brow,

 But out alack, he was but one hour mine,

 The region cloud hath masked him from me now.

 Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,

 Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.

 34

 Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,

 And make me travel forth without my cloak,

 To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,

 Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?

 'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,

 To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,

 For no man well of such a salve can speak,

 That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:

 Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,

 Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,

 Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief

 To him that bears the strong offence's cross.

 Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,

 And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.

 35

 No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,

 Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,

 Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,

 And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.

 All men make faults, and even I in this,

 Authorizing thy trespass with compare,

 My self corrupting salving thy amiss,

 Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:

 For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,

 Thy adverse party is thy advocate,

 And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:

 Such civil war is in my love and hate,

 That I an accessary needs must be,

 To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

 36

 Let me confess that we two must be twain,

 Although our undivided loves are one:

 So shall those blots that do with me remain,

 Without thy help, by me be borne alone.

 In our two loves there is but one respect,

 Though in our lives a separable spite,

 Which though it alter not love's sole effect,

 Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.

 I may not evermore acknowledge thee,

 Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,

 Nor thou with public kindness honour me,

 Unless thou take that honour from thy name:

 But do not so, I love thee in such sort,

 As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

 37

 As a decrepit father takes delight,

 To see his active child do deeds of youth,

 So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite

 Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.

 For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,

 Or any of these all, or all, or more

 Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,

 I make my love engrafted to this store:

 So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,

 Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,

 That I in thy abundance am sufficed,

 And by a part of all thy glory live:

 Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,

 This wish I have, then ten times happy me.

 38

 How can my muse want subject to invent

 While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,

 Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,

 For every vulgar paper to rehearse?

 O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,

 Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,

 For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,

 When thou thy self dost give invention light?

 Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth

 Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,

 And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth

 Eternal numbers to outlive long date.

 If my slight muse do please these curious days,

 The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

 39

 O how thy worth with manners may I sing,

 When thou art all the better part of me?

 What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:

 And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?

 Even for this, let us divided live,

 And our dear love lose name of single one,

 That by this separation I may give:

 That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:

 O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,

 Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,

 To entertain the time with thoughts of love,

 Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.

 And that thou teachest how to make one twain,

 By praising him here who doth hence remain.

 40

 Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,

 What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?

 No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,

 All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:

 Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,

 I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,

 But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest

 By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.

 I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief

 Although thou steal thee all my poverty:

 And yet love knows it is a greater grief

 To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.

 Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,

 Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

 41

 Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,

 When I am sometime absent from thy heart,

 Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,

 For still temptation follows where thou art.

 Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,

 Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.

 And when a woman woos, what woman's son,

 Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?

 Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,

 And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,

 Who lead thee in their riot even there

 Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:

 Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,

 Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

 42

 That thou hast her it is not all my grief,

 And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,

 That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,

 A loss in love that touches me more nearly.

 Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,

 Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,

 And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,

 Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.

 If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,

 And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,

 Both find each other, and I lose both twain,

 And both for my sake lay on me this cross,

 But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,

 Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.

 43

 When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,

 For all the day they view things unrespected,

 But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,

 And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.

 Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright

 How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,

 To the clear day with thy much clearer light,

 When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!

 How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,

 By looking on thee in the living day,

 When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,

 Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!

 All days are nights to see till I see thee,

 And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

 44

 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,

 Injurious distance should not stop my way,

 For then despite of space I would be brought,

 From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,

 No matter then although my foot did stand

 Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,

 For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,

 As soon as think the place where he would be.

 But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought

 To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,

 But that so much of earth and water wrought,

 I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.

 Receiving nought by elements so slow,

 But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.

 45

 The other two, slight air, and purging fire,

 Are both with thee, wherever I abide,

 The first my thought, the other my desire,

 These present-absent with swift motion slide.

 For when these quicker elements are gone

 In tender embassy of love to thee,

 My life being made of four, with two alone,

 Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.

 Until life's composition be recured,

 By those swift messengers returned from thee,

 Who even but now come back again assured,

 Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.

 This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,

 I send them back again and straight grow sad.

 46

 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,

 How to divide the conquest of thy sight,

 Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,

 My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,

 My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,

 (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)

 But the defendant doth that plea deny,

 And says in him thy fair appearance lies.

 To side this title is impanelled

 A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,

 And by their verdict is determined

 The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part.

 As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,

 And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.

 47

 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,

 And each doth good turns now unto the other,

 When that mine eye is famished for a look,

 Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;

 With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,

 And to the painted banquet bids my heart:

 Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,

 And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.

 So either by thy picture or my love,

 Thy self away, art present still with me,

 For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,

 And I am still with them, and they with thee.

 Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight

 Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.

 48

 How careful was I when I took my way,

 Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,

 That to my use it might unused stay

 From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!

 But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,

 Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,

 Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,

 Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.

 Thee have I not locked up in any chest,

 Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,

 Within the gentle closure of my breast,

 From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,

 And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,

 For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.

 49

 Against that time (if ever that time come)

 When I shall see thee frown on my defects,

 When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,

 Called to that audit by advised respects,

 Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,

 And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,

 When love converted from the thing it was

 Shall reasons find of settled gravity;

 Against that time do I ensconce me here

 Within the knowledge of mine own desert,

 And this my hand, against my self uprear,

 To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,

 To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,

 Since why to love, I can allege no cause.

 50

 How heavy do I journey on the way,

 When what I seek (my weary travel's end)

 Doth teach that case and that repose to say

 'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'

 The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,

 Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,

 As if by some instinct the wretch did know

 His rider loved not speed being made from thee:

 The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,

 That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,

 Which heavily he answers with a groan,

 More sharp to me than spurring to his side,

 For that same groan doth put this in my mind,

 My grief lies onward and my joy behind.

 51

 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,

 Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,

 From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?

 Till I return of posting is no need.

 O what excuse will my poor beast then find,

 When swift extremity can seem but slow?

 Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,

 In winged speed no motion shall I know,

 Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,

 Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)

 Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,

 But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,

 Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,

 Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.

 52

 So am I as the rich whose blessed key,

 Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,

 The which he will not every hour survey,

 For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.

 Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,

 Since seldom coming in that long year set,

 Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,

 Or captain jewels in the carcanet.

 So is the time that keeps you as my chest

 Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,

 To make some special instant special-blest,

 By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.

 Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,

 Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.

 53

 What is your substance, whereof are you made,

 That millions of strange shadows on you tend?

 Since every one, hath every one, one shade,

 And you but one, can every shadow lend:

 Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,

 Is poorly imitated after you,

 On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,

 And you in Grecian tires are painted new:

 Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,

 The one doth shadow of your beauty show,

 The other as your bounty doth appear,

 And you in every blessed shape we know.

 In all external grace you have some part,

 But you like none, none you for constant heart.

 54

 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,

 By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!

 The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem

 For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:

 The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,

 As the perfumed tincture of the roses,

 Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,

 When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:

 But for their virtue only is their show,

 They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,

 Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,

 Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:

 And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,

 When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

 55

 Not marble, nor the gilded monuments

 Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,

 But you shall shine more bright in these contents

 Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.

 When wasteful war shall statues overturn,

 And broils root out the work of masonry,

 Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:

 The living record of your memory.

 'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity

 Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,

 Even in the eyes of all posterity

 That wear this world out to the ending doom.

 So till the judgment that your self arise,

 You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

 56

 Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said

 Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,

 Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,

 To-morrow sharpened in his former might.

 So love be thou, although to-day thou fill

 Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,

 To-morrow see again, and do not kill

 The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:

 Let this sad interim like the ocean be

 Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,

 Come daily to the banks, that when they see:

 Return of love, more blest may be the view.

 Or call it winter, which being full of care,

 Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

 57

 Being your slave what should I do but tend,

 Upon the hours, and times of your desire?

 I have no precious time at all to spend;

 Nor services to do till you require.

 Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,

 Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,

 Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,

 When you have bid your servant once adieu.

 Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,

 Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,

 But like a sad slave stay and think of nought

 Save where you are, how happy you make those.

 So true a fool is love, that in your will,

 (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.

 58

 That god forbid, that made me first your slave,

 I should in thought control your times of pleasure,

 Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,

 Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.

 O let me suffer (being at your beck)

 Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,

 And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,

 Without accusing you of injury.

 Be where you list, your charter is so strong,

 That you your self may privilage your time

 To what you will, to you it doth belong,

 Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.

 I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,

 Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

 59

 If there be nothing new, but that which is,

 Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,

 Which labouring for invention bear amis

 The second burthen of a former child!

 O that record could with a backward look,

 Even of five hundred courses of the sun,

 Show me your image in some antique book,

 Since mind at first in character was done.

 That I might see what the old world could say,

 To this composed wonder of your frame,

 Whether we are mended, or whether better they,

 Or whether revolution be the same.

 O sure I am the wits of former days,

 To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

 60

 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,

 So do our minutes hasten to their end,

 Each changing place with that which goes before,

 In sequent toil all forwards do contend.

 Nativity once in the main of light,

 Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,

 Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,

 And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.

 Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,

 And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,

 Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,

 And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.

 And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand

 Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.

 61

 Is it thy will, thy image should keep open

 My heavy eyelids to the weary night?

 Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,

 While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?

 Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee

 So far from home into my deeds to pry,

 To find out shames and idle hours in me,

 The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?

 O no, thy love though much, is not so great,

 It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,

 Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,

 To play the watchman ever for thy sake.

 For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,

 From me far off, with others all too near.

 62

 Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,

 And all my soul, and all my every part;

 And for this sin there is no remedy,

 It is so grounded inward in my heart.

 Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,

 No shape so true, no truth of such account,

 And for my self mine own worth do define,

 As I all other in all worths surmount.

 But when my glass shows me my self indeed

 beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,

 Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:

 Self, so self-loving were iniquity.

 'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,

 Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

 63

 Against my love shall be as I am now

 With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,

 When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow

 With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn

 Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,

 And all those beauties whereof now he's king

 Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,

 Stealing away the treasure of his spring:

 For such a time do I now fortify

 Against confounding age's cruel knife,

 That he shall never cut from memory

 My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.

 His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,

 And they shall live, and he in them still green.

 64

 When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced

 The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,

 When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,

 And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.

 When I have seen the hungry ocean gain

 Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,

 And the firm soil win of the watery main,

 Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.

 When I have seen such interchange of State,

 Or state it self confounded, to decay,

 Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate

 That Time will come and take my love away.

 This thought is as a death which cannot choose

 But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.

 65

 Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,

 But sad mortality o'ersways their power,

 How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,

 Whose action is no stronger than a flower?

 O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,

 Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,

 When rocks impregnable are not so stout,

 Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?

 O fearful meditation, where alack,

 Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?

 Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,

 Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?

 O none, unless this miracle have might,

 That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

 66

 Tired with all these for restful death I cry,

 As to behold desert a beggar born,

 And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,

 And purest faith unhappily forsworn,

 And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,

 And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,

 And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,

 And strength by limping sway disabled

 And art made tongue-tied by authority,

 And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,

 And simple truth miscalled simplicity,

 And captive good attending captain ill.

 Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,

 Save that to die, I leave my love alone.

 67

 Ah wherefore with infection should he live,

 And with his presence grace impiety,

 That sin by him advantage should achieve,

 And lace it self with his society?

 Why should false painting imitate his cheek,

 And steal dead seeming of his living hue?

 Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,

 Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?

 Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,

 Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,

 For she hath no exchequer now but his,

 And proud of many, lives upon his gains?

 O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,

 In days long since, before these last so bad.

 68

 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,

 When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,

 Before these bastard signs of fair were born,

 Or durst inhabit on a living brow:

 Before the golden tresses of the dead,

 The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,

 To live a second life on second head,

 Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:

 In him those holy antique hours are seen,

 Without all ornament, it self and true,

 Making no summer of another's green,

 Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,

 And him as for a map doth Nature store,

 To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

 69

 Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,

 Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:

 All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,

 Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.

 Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,

 But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,

 In other accents do this praise confound

 By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.

 They look into the beauty of thy mind,

 And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,

 Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind) To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:

 But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,

 The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

 70

 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,

 For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,

 The ornament of beauty is suspect,

 A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.

 So thou be good, slander doth but approve,

 Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,

 For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,

 And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.

 Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,

 Either not assailed, or victor being charged,

 Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,

 To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,

 If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,

 Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

 71

 No longer mourn for me when I am dead,

 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell

 Give warning to the world that I am fled

 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:

 Nay if you read this line, remember not,

 The hand that writ it, for I love you so,

 That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,

 If thinking on me then should make you woe.

 O if (I say) you look upon this verse,

 When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,

 Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;

 But let your love even with my life decay.

 Lest the wise world should look into your moan,

 And mock you with me after I am gone.

 72

 O lest the world should task you to recite,

 What merit lived in me that you should love

 After my death (dear love) forget me quite,

 For you in me can nothing worthy prove.

 Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,

 To do more for me than mine own desert,

 And hang more praise upon deceased I,

 Than niggard truth would willingly impart:

 O lest your true love may seem false in this,

 That you for love speak well of me untrue,

 My name be buried where my body is,

 And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.

 For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,

 And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

 73

 That time of year thou mayst in me behold,

 When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang

 Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,

 Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

 In me thou seest the twilight of such day,

 As after sunset fadeth in the west,

 Which by and by black night doth take away,

 Death's second self that seals up all in rest.

 In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,

 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,

 As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,

 Consumed with that which it was nourished by.

 This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

 74

 But be contented when that fell arrest,

 Without all bail shall carry me away,

 My life hath in this line some interest,

 Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.

 When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,

 The very part was consecrate to thee,

 The earth can have but earth, which is his due,

 My spirit is thine the better part of me,

 So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,

 The prey of worms, my body being dead,

 The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,

 Too base of thee to be remembered,

 The worth of that, is that which it contains,

 And that is this, and this with thee remains.

 75

 So are you to my thoughts as food to life,

 Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;

 And for the peace of you I hold such strife

 As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.

 Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon

 Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,

 Now counting best to be with you alone,

 Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,

 Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,

 And by and by clean starved for a look,

 Possessing or pursuing no delight

 Save what is had, or must from you be took.

 Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,

 Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

 76

 Why is my verse so barren of new pride?

 So far from variation or quick change?

 Why with the time do I not glance aside

 To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?

 Why write I still all one, ever the same,

 And keep invention in a noted weed,

 That every word doth almost tell my name,

 Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?

 O know sweet love I always write of you,

 And you and love are still my argument:

 So all my best is dressing old words new,

 Spending again what is already spent:

 For as the sun is daily new and old,

 So is my love still telling what is told.

 77

 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,

 Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,

 These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,

 And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.

 The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,

 Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,

 Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,

 Time's thievish progress to eternity.

 Look what thy memory cannot contain,

 Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find

 Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,

 To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.

 These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,

 Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.

 78

 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,

 And found such fair assistance in my verse,

 As every alien pen hath got my use,

 And under thee their poesy disperse.

 Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,

 And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,

 Have added feathers to the learned's wing,

 And given grace a double majesty.

 Yet be most proud of that which I compile,

 Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,

 In others' works thou dost but mend the style,

 And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.

 But thou art all my art, and dost advance

 As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

 79

 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,

 My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,

 But now my gracious numbers are decayed,

 And my sick muse doth give an other place.

 I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument

 Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,

 Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,

 He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,

 He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,

 From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give

 And found it in thy cheek: he can afford

 No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.

 Then thank him not for that which he doth say,

 Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.

 80

 O how I faint when I of you do write,

 Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,

 And in the praise thereof spends all his might,

 To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.

 But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)

 The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,

 My saucy bark (inferior far to his)

 On your broad main doth wilfully appear.

 Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,

 Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,

 Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,

 He of tall building, and of goodly pride.

 Then if he thrive and I be cast away,

 The worst was this, my love was my decay.

 81

 Or I shall live your epitaph to make,

 Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,

 From hence your memory death cannot take,

 Although in me each part will be forgotten.

 Your name from hence immortal life shall have,

 Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,

 The earth can yield me but a common grave,

 When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,

 Your monument shall be my gentle verse,

 Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,

 And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,

 When all the breathers of this world are dead,

 You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)

 Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

 82

 I grant thou wert not married to my muse,

 And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook

 The dedicated words which writers use

 Of their fair subject, blessing every book.

 Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,

 Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,

 And therefore art enforced to seek anew,

 Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.

 And do so love, yet when they have devised,

 What strained touches rhetoric can lend,

 Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,

 In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.

 And their gross painting might be better used,

 Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.

 83

 I never saw that you did painting need,

 And therefore to your fair no painting set,

 I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,

 That barren tender of a poet's debt:

 And therefore have I slept in your report,

 That you your self being extant well might show,

 How far a modern quill doth come too short,

 Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.

 This silence for my sin you did impute,

 Which shall be most my glory being dumb,

 For I impair not beauty being mute,

 When others would give life, and bring a tomb.

 There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,

 Than both your poets can in praise devise.

 84

 Who is it that says most, which can say more,

 Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?

 In whose confine immured is the store,

 Which should example where your equal grew.

 Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,

 That to his subject lends not some small glory,

 But he that writes of you, if he can tell,

 That you are you, so dignifies his story.

 Let him but copy what in you is writ,

 Not making worse what nature made so clear,

 And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,

 Making his style admired every where.

 You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,

 Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

 85

 My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,

 While comments of your praise richly compiled,

 Reserve their character with golden quill,

 And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.

 I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,

 And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,

 To every hymn that able spirit affords,

 In polished form of well refined pen.

 Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,

 And to the most of praise add something more,

 But that is in my thought, whose love to you

 (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,

 Then others, for the breath of words respect,

 Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

 86

 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,

 Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,

 That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,

 Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?

 Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,

 Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?

 No, neither he, nor his compeers by night

 Giving him aid, my verse astonished.

 He nor that affable familiar ghost

 Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,

 As victors of my silence cannot boast,

 I was not sick of any fear from thence.

 But when your countenance filled up his line,

 Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.

 87

 Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,

 And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,

 The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:

 My bonds in thee are all determinate.

 For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,

 And for that riches where is my deserving?

 The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,

 And so my patent back again is swerving.

 Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,

 Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,

 So thy great gift upon misprision growing,

 Comes home again, on better judgement making.

 Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,

 In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

 88

 When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,

 And place my merit in the eye of scorn,

 Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,

 And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:

 With mine own weakness being best acquainted,

 Upon thy part I can set down a story

 Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:

 That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:

 And I by this will be a gainer too,

 For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,

 The injuries that to my self I do,

 Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.

 Such is my love, to thee I so belong,

 That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.

 89

 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,

 And I will comment upon that offence,

 Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:

 Against thy reasons making no defence.

 Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,

 To set a form upon desired change,

 As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,

 I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:

 Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,

 Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,

 Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:

 And haply of our old acquaintance tell.

 For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,

 For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.

 90

 Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,

 Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,

 join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,

 And do not drop in for an after-loss:

 Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,

 Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,

 Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,

 To linger out a purposed overthrow.

 If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,

 When other petty griefs have done their spite,

 But in the onset come, so shall I taste

 At first the very worst of fortune's might.

 And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,

 Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.

 91

 Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,

 Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,

 Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:

 Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.

 And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,

 Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,

 But these particulars are not my measure,

 All these I better in one general best.

 Thy love is better than high birth to me,

 Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,

 Of more delight than hawks and horses be:

 And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.

 Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,

 All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

 92

 But do thy worst to steal thy self away,

 For term of life thou art assured mine,

 And life no longer than thy love will stay,

 For it depends upon that love of thine.

 Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,

 When in the least of them my life hath end,

 I see, a better state to me belongs

 Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.

 Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,

 Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,

 O what a happy title do I find,

 Happy to have thy love, happy to die!

 But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?

 Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

 93

 So shall I live, supposing thou art true,

 Like a deceived husband, so love's face,

 May still seem love to me, though altered new:

 Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.

 For there can live no hatred in thine eye,

 Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,

 In many's looks, the false heart's history

 Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.

 But heaven in thy creation did decree,

 That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,

 Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,

 Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.

 How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,

 If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.

 94

 They that have power to hurt, and will do none,

 That do not do the thing, they most do show,

 Who moving others, are themselves as stone,

 Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:

 They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,

 And husband nature's riches from expense,

 Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,

 Others, but stewards of their excellence:

 The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,

 Though to it self, it only live and die,

 But if that flower with base infection meet,

 The basest weed outbraves his dignity:

 For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,

 Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

 95

 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,

 Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,

 Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!

 O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!

 That tongue that tells the story of thy days,

 (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)

 Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,

 Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.

 O what a mansion have those vices got,

 Which for their habitation chose out thee,

 Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,

 And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!

 Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,

 The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.

 96

 Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,

 Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,

 Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:

 Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:

 As on the finger of a throned queen,

 The basest jewel will be well esteemed:

 So are those errors that in thee are seen,

 To truths translated, and for true things deemed.

 How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,

 If like a lamb he could his looks translate!

 How many gazers mightst thou lead away,

 if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!

 But do not so, I love thee in such sort,

 As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

 97

 How like a winter hath my absence been

 From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!

 What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!

 What old December's bareness everywhere!

 And yet this time removed was summer's time,

 The teeming autumn big with rich increase,

 Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,

 Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:

 Yet this abundant issue seemed to me

 But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,

 For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,

 And thou away, the very birds are mute.

 Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,

 That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

 98

 From you have I been absent in the spring,

 When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)

 Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:

 That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.

 Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell

 Of different flowers in odour and in hue,

 Could make me any summer's story tell:

 Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:

 Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,

 Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,

 They were but sweet, but figures of delight:

 Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.

 Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,

 As with your shadow I with these did play.

 99

 The forward violet thus did I chide,

 Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, If not from my love's breath? The purple pride

 Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,

 In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.

 The lily I condemned for thy hand,

 And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,

 The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,

 One blushing shame, another white despair:

 A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,

 And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,

 But for his theft in pride of all his growth

 A vengeful canker eat him up to death.

 More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,

 But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.

 100

 Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,

 To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?

 Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,

 Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?

 Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,

 In gentle numbers time so idly spent,

 Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,

 And gives thy pen both skill and argument.

 Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,

 If time have any wrinkle graven there,

 If any, be a satire to decay,

 And make time's spoils despised everywhere.

 Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,

 So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.

 101

 O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,

 For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?

 Both truth and beauty on my love depends:

 So dost thou too, and therein dignified:

 Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,

 'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,

 Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:

 But best is best, if never intermixed'?

 Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?

 Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,

 To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:

 And to be praised of ages yet to be.

 Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,

 To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.

 102

 My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,

 I love not less, though less the show appear,

 That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,

 The owner's tongue doth publish every where.

 Our love was new, and then but in the spring,

 When I was wont to greet it with my lays,

 As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,

 And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:

 Not that the summer is less pleasant now

 Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,

 But that wild music burthens every bough,

 And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.

 Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:

 Because I would not dull you with my song.

 103

 Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,

 That having such a scope to show her pride,

 The argument all bare is of more worth

 Than when it hath my added praise beside.

 O blame me not if I no more can write!

 Look in your glass and there appears a face,

 That over-goes my blunt invention quite,

 Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.

 Were it not sinful then striving to mend,

 To mar the subject that before was well?

 For to no other pass my verses tend,

 Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.

 And more, much more than in my verse can sit,

 Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.

 104

 To me fair friend you never can be old,

 For as you were when first your eye I eyed,

 Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,

 Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,

 Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,

 In process of the seasons have I seen,

 Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,

 Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.

 Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,

 Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,

 So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand

 Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.

 For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,

 Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.

 105

 Let not my love be called idolatry,

 Nor my beloved as an idol show,

 Since all alike my songs and praises be

 To one, of one, still such, and ever so.

 Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,

 Still constant in a wondrous excellence,

 Therefore my verse to constancy confined,

 One thing expressing, leaves out difference.

 Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,

 Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,

 And in this change is my invention spent,

 Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.

 Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.

 Which three till now, never kept seat in one.

 106

 When in the chronicle of wasted time,

 I see descriptions of the fairest wights,

 And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,

 In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,

 Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,

 Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,

 I see their antique pen would have expressed,

 Even such a beauty as you master now.

 So all their praises are but prophecies

 Of this our time, all you prefiguring,

 And for they looked but with divining eyes,

 They had not skill enough your worth to sing:

 For we which now behold these present days,

 Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

 107

 Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,

 Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,

 Can yet the lease of my true love control,

 Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.

 The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,

 And the sad augurs mock their own presage,

 Incertainties now crown themselves assured,

 And peace proclaims olives of endless age.

 Now with the drops of this most balmy time,

 My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,

 Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,

 While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.

 And thou in this shalt find thy monument,

 When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

 108

 What's in the brain that ink may character,

 Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,

 What's new to speak, what now to register,

 That may express my love, or thy dear merit?

 Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,

 I must each day say o'er the very same,

 Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,

 Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.

 So that eternal love in love's fresh case,

 Weighs not the dust and injury of age,

 Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,

 But makes antiquity for aye his page,

 Finding the first conceit of love there bred,

 Where time and outward form would show it dead.

 109

 O never say that I was false of heart,

 Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,

 As easy might I from my self depart,

 As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:

 That is my home of love, if I have ranged,

 Like him that travels I return again,

 Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,

 So that my self bring water for my stain,

 Never believe though in my nature reigned,

 All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,

 That it could so preposterously be stained,

 To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:

 For nothing this wide universe I call,

 Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.

 110

 Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,

 And made my self a motley to the view,

 Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,

 Made old offences of affections new.

 Most true it is, that I have looked on truth

 Askance and strangely: but by all above,

 These blenches gave my heart another youth,

 And worse essays proved thee my best of love.

 Now all is done, have what shall have no end,

 Mine appetite I never more will grind

 On newer proof, to try an older friend,

 A god in love, to whom I am confined.

 Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,

 Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

 111

 O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,

 The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,

 That did not better for my life provide,

 Than public means which public manners breeds.

 Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,

 And almost thence my nature is subdued

 To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:

 Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,

 Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,

 Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,

 No bitterness that I will bitter think,

 Nor double penance to correct correction.

 Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,

 Even that your pity is enough to cure me.

 112

 Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,

 Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,

 For what care I who calls me well or ill,

 So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?

 You are my all the world, and I must strive,

 To know my shames and praises from your tongue,

 None else to me, nor I to none alive,

 That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.

 In so profound abysm I throw all care

 Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,

 To critic and to flatterer stopped are:

 Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.

 You are so strongly in my purpose bred,

 That all the world besides methinks are dead.

 113

 Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,

 And that which governs me to go about,

 Doth part his function, and is partly blind,

 Seems seeing, but effectually is out:

 For it no form delivers to the heart

 Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,

 Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,

 Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:

 For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,

 The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,

 The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:

 The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.

 Incapable of more, replete with you,

 My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.

 114

 Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you

 Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?

 Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,

 And that your love taught it this alchemy?

 To make of monsters, and things indigest,

 Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,

 Creating every bad a perfect best

 As fast as objects to his beams assemble:

 O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,

 And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,

 Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,

 And to his palate doth prepare the cup.

 If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,

 That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.

 115

 Those lines that I before have writ do lie,

 Even those that said I could not love you dearer,

 Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,

 My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,

 But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents

 Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,

 Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,

 Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:

 Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,

 Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'

 When I was certain o'er incertainty,

 Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?

 Love is a babe, then might I not say so

 To give full growth to that which still doth grow.

 116

 Let me not to the marriage of true minds

 Admit impediments, love is not love

 Which alters when it alteration finds,

 Or bends with the remover to remove.

 O no, it is an ever-fixed mark

 That looks on tempests and is never shaken;

 It is the star to every wand'ring bark,

 Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.

 Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks

 Within his bending sickle's compass come,

 Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,

 But bears it out even to the edge of doom:

 If this be error and upon me proved,

 I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

 117

 Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,

 Wherein I should your great deserts repay,

 Forgot upon your dearest love to call,

 Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,

 That I have frequent been with unknown minds,

 And given to time your own dear-purchased right,

 That I have hoisted sail to all the winds

 Which should transport me farthest from your sight.

 Book both my wilfulness and errors down,

 And on just proof surmise, accumulate,

 Bring me within the level of your frown,

 But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:

 Since my appeal says I did strive to prove

 The constancy and virtue of your love.

 118

 Like as to make our appetite more keen

 With eager compounds we our palate urge,

 As to prevent our maladies unseen,

 We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.

 Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,

 To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;

 And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,

 To be diseased ere that there was true needing.

 Thus policy in love t' anticipate

 The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,

 And brought to medicine a healthful state

 Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.

 But thence I learn and find the lesson true,

 Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.

 119

 What potions have I drunk of Siren tears

 Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,

 Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,

 Still losing when I saw my self to win!

 What wretched errors hath my heart committed,

 Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!

 How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted

 In the distraction of this madding fever!

 O benefit of ill, now I find true

 That better is, by evil still made better.

 And ruined love when it is built anew

 Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.

 So I return rebuked to my content,

 And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.

 120

 That you were once unkind befriends me now,

 And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,

 Needs must I under my transgression bow,

 Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.

 For if you were by my unkindness shaken

 As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,

 And I a tyrant have no leisure taken

 To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.

 O that our night of woe might have remembered

 My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,

 And soon to you, as you to me then tendered

 The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!

 But that your trespass now becomes a fee,

 Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.

 121

 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,

 When not to be, receives reproach of being,

 And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,

 Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.

 For why should others' false adulterate eyes

 Give salutation to my sportive blood?

 Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,

 Which in their wills count bad what I think good?

 No, I am that I am, and they that level

 At my abuses, reckon up their own,

 I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;

 By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown

 Unless this general evil they maintain,

 All men are bad and in their badness reign.

 122

 Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain

 Full charactered with lasting memory,

 Which shall above that idle rank remain

 Beyond all date even to eternity.

 Or at the least, so long as brain and heart

 Have faculty by nature to subsist,

 Till each to razed oblivion yield his part

 Of thee, thy record never can be missed:

 That poor retention could not so much hold,

 Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,

 Therefore to give them from me was I bold,

 To trust those tables that receive thee more:

 To keep an adjunct to remember thee

 Were to import forgetfulness in me.

 123

 No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,

 Thy pyramids built up with newer might

 To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,

 They are but dressings Of a former sight:

 Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,

 What thou dost foist upon us that is old,

 And rather make them born to our desire,

 Than think that we before have heard them told:

 Thy registers and thee I both defy,

 Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,

 For thy records, and what we see doth lie,

 Made more or less by thy continual haste:

 This I do vow and this shall ever be,

 I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

 124

 If my dear love were but the child of state,

 It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,

 As subject to time's love or to time's hate,

 Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.

 No it was builded far from accident,

 It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls

 Under the blow of thralled discontent,

 Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:

 It fears not policy that heretic,

 Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,

 But all alone stands hugely politic,

 That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.

 To this I witness call the fools of time,

 Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

 125

 Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,

 With my extern the outward honouring,

 Or laid great bases for eternity,

 Which proves more short than waste or ruining?

 Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour

 Lose all, and more by paying too much rent

 For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,

 Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?

 No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,

 And take thou my oblation, poor but free,

 Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,

 But mutual render, only me for thee.

 Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul

 When most impeached, stands least in thy control.

 126

 O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,

 Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:

 Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,

 Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

 If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)

 As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,

 She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill

 May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.

 Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,

 She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!

 Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,

 And her quietus is to render thee.

 127

 In the old age black was not counted fair,

 Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:

 But now is black beauty's successive heir,

 And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,

 For since each hand hath put on nature's power,

 Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,

 Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,

 But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.

 Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,

 Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,

 At such who not born fair no beauty lack,

 Slandering creation with a false esteem,

 Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,

 That every tongue says beauty should look so.

 128

 How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,

 Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds

 With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st

 The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,

 Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,

 To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,

 Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,

 At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.

 To be so tickled they would change their state

 And situation with those dancing chips,

 O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,

 Making dead wood more blest than living lips,

 Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,

 Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

 129

 Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame

 Is lust in action, and till action, lust

 Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,

 Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,

 Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,

 Past reason hunted, and no sooner had

 Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,

 On purpose laid to make the taker mad.

 Mad in pursuit and in possession so,

 Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,

 A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,

 Before a joy proposed behind a dream.

 All this the world well knows yet none knows well,

 To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

 130

 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,

 Coral is far more red, than her lips red,

 If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:

 If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:

 I have seen roses damasked, red and white,

 But no such roses see I in her cheeks,

 And in some perfumes is there more delight,

 Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.

 I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,

 That music hath a far more pleasing sound:

 I grant I never saw a goddess go,

 My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.

 And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,

 As any she belied with false compare.

 131

 Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,

 As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;

 For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart

 Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.

 Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,

 Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;

 To say they err, I dare not be so bold,

 Although I swear it to my self alone.

 And to be sure that is not false I swear,

 A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,

 One on another's neck do witness bear

 Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.

 In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,

 And thence this slander as I think proceeds.

 132

 Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,

 Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,

 Have put on black, and loving mourners be,

 Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.

 And truly not the morning sun of heaven

 Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,

 Nor that full star that ushers in the even

 Doth half that glory to the sober west

 As those two mourning eyes become thy face:

 O let it then as well beseem thy heart

 To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,

 And suit thy pity like in every part.

 Then will I swear beauty herself is black,

 And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

 133

 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan

 For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;

 Is't not enough to torture me alone,

 But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?

 Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,

 And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,

 Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,

 A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:

 Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,

 But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,

 Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,

 Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.

 And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,

 Perforce am thine and all that is in me.

 134

 So now I have confessed that he is thine,

 And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,

 My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,

 Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:

 But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,

 For thou art covetous, and he is kind,

 He learned but surety-like to write for me,

 Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.

 The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,

 Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,

 And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,

 So him I lose through my unkind abuse.

 Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,

 He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.

 135

 Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,

 And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,

 More than enough am I that vex thee still,

 To thy sweet will making addition thus.

 Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,

 Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?

 Shall will in others seem right gracious,

 And in my will no fair acceptance shine?

 The sea all water, yet receives rain still,

 And in abundance addeth to his store,

 So thou being rich in will add to thy will

 One will of mine to make thy large will more.

 Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,

 Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'

 136

 If thy soul check thee that I come so near,

 Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',

 And will thy soul knows is admitted there,

 Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.

 'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,

 Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,

 In things of great receipt with case we prove,

 Among a number one is reckoned none.

 Then in the number let me pass untold,

 Though in thy store's account I one must be,

 For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,

 That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.

 Make but my name thy love, and love that still,

 And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.

 137

 Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,

 That they behold and see not what they see?

 They know what beauty is, see where it lies,

 Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.

 If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,

 Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,

 Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,

 Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?

 Why should my heart think that a several plot,

 Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?

 Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not

 To put fair truth upon so foul a face?

 In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,

 And to this false plague are they now transferred.

 138

 When my love swears that she is made of truth,

 I do believe her though I know she lies,

 That she might think me some untutored youth,

 Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.

 Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,

 Although she knows my days are past the best,

 Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,

 On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:

 But wherefore says she not she is unjust?

 And wherefore say not I that I am old?

 O love's best habit is in seeming trust,

 And age in love, loves not to have years told.

 Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,

 And in our faults by lies we flattered be.

 139

 O call not me to justify the wrong,

 That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,

 Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,

 Use power with power, and slay me not by art,

 Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,

 Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,

 What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might

 Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?

 Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,

 Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,

 And therefore from my face she turns my foes,

 That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:

 Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,

 Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.

 140

 Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press

 My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:

 Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,

 The manner of my pity-wanting pain.

 If I might teach thee wit better it were,

 Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,

 As testy sick men when their deaths be near,

 No news but health from their physicians know.

 For if I should despair I should grow mad,

 And in my madness might speak ill of thee,

 Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,

 Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.

 That I may not be so, nor thou belied,

 Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

 141

 In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,

 For they in thee a thousand errors note,

 But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,

 Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.

 Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,

 Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,

 Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited

 To any sensual feast with thee alone:

 But my five wits, nor my five senses can

 Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,

 Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,

 Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:

 Only my plague thus far I count my gain,

 That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.

 142

 Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,

 Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,

 O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,

 And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,

 Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,

 That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,

 And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,

 Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.

 Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,

 Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,

 Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,

 Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.

 If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,

 By self-example mayst thou be denied.

 143

 Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,

 One of her feathered creatures broke away,

 Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch

 In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:

 Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,

 Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,

 To follow that which flies before her face:

 Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;

 So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,

 Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,

 But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:

 And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.

 So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,

 If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

 144

 Two loves I have of comfort and despair,

 Which like two spirits do suggest me still,

 The better angel is a man right fair:

 The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.

 To win me soon to hell my female evil,

 Tempteth my better angel from my side,

 And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:

 Wooing his purity with her foul pride.

 And whether that my angel be turned fiend,

 Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,

 But being both from me both to each friend,

 I guess one angel in another's hell.

 Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,

 Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

 145

 Those lips that Love's own hand did make,

 Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',

 To me that languished for her sake:

 But when she saw my woeful state,

 Straight in her heart did mercy come,

 Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,

 Was used in giving gentle doom:

 And taught it thus anew to greet:

 'I hate' she altered with an end,

 That followed it as gentle day,

 Doth follow night who like a fiend

 From heaven to hell is flown away.

 'I hate', from hate away she threw,

 And saved my life saying 'not you'.

 146

 Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,

 My sinful earth these rebel powers array,

 Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth

 Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?

 Why so large cost having so short a lease,

 Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?

 Shall worms inheritors of this excess

 Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?

 Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,

 And let that pine to aggravate thy store;

 Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;

 Within be fed, without be rich no more,

 So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,

 And death once dead, there's no more dying then.

 147

 My love is as a fever longing still,

 For that which longer nurseth the disease,

 Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,

 Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:

 My reason the physician to my love,

 Angry that his prescriptions are not kept

 Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,

 Desire is death, which physic did except.

 Past cure I am, now reason is past care,

 And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,

 My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,

 At random from the truth vainly expressed.

 For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,

 Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

 148

 O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,

 Which have no correspondence with true sight,

 Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,

 That censures falsely what they see aright?

 If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,

 What means the world to say it is not so?

 If it be not, then love doth well denote,

 Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,

 How can it? O how can love's eye be true,

 That is so vexed with watching and with tears?

 No marvel then though I mistake my view,

 The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.

 O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,

 Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

 149

 Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,

 When I against my self with thee partake?

 Do I not think on thee when I forgot

 Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?

 Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,

 On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,

 Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend

 Revenge upon my self with present moan?

 What merit do I in my self respect,

 That is so proud thy service to despise,

 When all my best doth worship thy defect,

 Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?

 But love hate on for now I know thy mind,

 Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

 150

 O from what power hast thou this powerful might,

 With insufficiency my heart to sway,

 To make me give the lie to my true sight,

 And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?

 Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,

 That in the very refuse of thy deeds,

 There is such strength and warrantise of skill,

 That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?

 Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,

 The more I hear and see just cause of hate?

 O though I love what others do abhor,

 With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.

 If thy unworthiness raised love in me,

 More worthy I to be beloved of thee.

 151

 Love is too young to know what conscience is,

 Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?

 Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,

 Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.

 For thou betraying me, I do betray

 My nobler part to my gross body's treason,

 My soul doth tell my body that he may,

 Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,

 But rising at thy name doth point out thee,

 As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,

 He is contented thy poor drudge to be,

 To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.

 No want of conscience hold it that I call,

 Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.

 152

 In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,

 But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,

 In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,

 In vowing new hate after new love bearing:

 But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,

 When I break twenty? I am perjured most,

 For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:

 And all my honest faith in thee is lost.

 For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:

 Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,

 And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,

 Or made them swear against the thing they see.

 For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,

 To swear against the truth so foul a be.

 153

 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,

 A maid of Dian's this advantage found,

 And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep

 In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:

 Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,

 A dateless lively heat still to endure,

 And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,

 Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:

 But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,

 The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,

 I sick withal the help of bath desired,

 And thither hied a sad distempered guest.

 But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,

 Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

 154

 The little Love-god lying once asleep,

 Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,

 Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,

 Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,

 The fairest votary took up that fire,

 Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,

 And so the general of hot desire,

 Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.

 This brand she quenched in a cool well by,

 Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,

 Growing a bath and healthful remedy,

 For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,

 Came there for cure and this by that I prove,

 Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

 SCENE:

 Rousillon; Paris; Florence; Marseilles

 ACT I. SCENE 1.

 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

 Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black

 COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew; but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

 LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such abundance.

 COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?

 LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time. COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the King's disease.

 LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?

 COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.

 LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality. BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of? LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.

 BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.

 LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

 COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my

 overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.

 LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

 COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to haveHELENA.

 I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

 LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive grief the enemy to the living.

 COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.

 BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

 LAFEU. How understand we that?

 COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father

 In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue

 Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness

 Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,

 Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy

 Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend

 Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,

 But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,

 That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,

 Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,

 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,

 Advise him.

 LAFEU. He cannot want the best

 That shall attend his love.

 COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram. Exit BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be servants to you! [To HELENA] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.

 LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your father. Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;

 And these great tears grace his remembrance more

 Than those I shed for him. What was he like?

 I have forgot him; my imagination

 Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.

 I am undone; there is no living, none,

 If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one

 That I should love a bright particular star

 And think to wed it, he is so above me.

 In his bright radiance and collateral light

 Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.

 Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:

 The hind that would be mated by the lion

 Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,

 To see him every hour; to sit and draw

 His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,

 In our heart's table-heart too capable

 Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.

 But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy

 Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

 Enter PAROLLES

 [Aside] One that goes with him. I love him for his sake; And yet I know him a notorious liar,

 Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;

 Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him

 That they take place when virtue's steely bones

 Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see

 Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

 PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!

 HELENA. And you, monarch!

 PAROLLES. No.

 HELENA. And no.

 PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?

 HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?

 PAROLLES. Keep him out.

 HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance. PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.

 HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men? PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.

 HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.

 PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't. Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with't.

 HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you anything with it?

 HELENA. Not my virginity yet.

 There shall your master have a thousand loves,

 A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,

 A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,

 A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,

 A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;

 His humble ambition, proud humility,

 His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,

 His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world

 Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms

 That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall heI

 know not what he shall. God send him well!

 The court's a learning-place, and he is onePAROLLES.

 What one, i' faith?

 HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pityPAROLLES.

 What's pity?

 HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't

 Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,

 Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,

 Might with effects of them follow our friends

 And show what we alone must think, which never

 Returns us thanks.

 Enter PAGE

 PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you. Exit PAGE PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.

 HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.

 HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.

 PAROLLES. Why under Man?

 HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars.

 PAROLLES. When he was predominant.

 HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

 PAROLLES. Why think you so?

 HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.

 PAROLLES. That's for advantage.

 HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

 PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.

 Exit

 HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,

 Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky

 Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull

 Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.

 What power is it which mounts my love so high,

 That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?

 The mightiest space in fortune nature brings

 To join like likes, and kiss like native things.

 Impossible be strange attempts to those

 That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose

 What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove

 To show her merit that did miss her love?

 The King's disease-my project may deceive me,

 But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me. Exit

 ACT I. SCENE 2.

 Paris. The KING'S palace

 Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with letters, and divers ATTENDANTS

 KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;

 Have fought with equal fortune, and continue

 A braving war.

 FIRST LORD. So 'tis reported, sir.

 KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,

 A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,

 With caution, that the Florentine will move us

 For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend

 Prejudicates the business, and would seem

 To have us make denial.

 FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,

 Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead

 For amplest credence.

 KING. He hath arm'd our answer,

 And Florence is denied before he comes;

 Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see

 The Tuscan service, freely have they leave

 To stand on either part.

 SECOND LORD. It well may serve

 A nursery to our gentry, who are sick

 For breathing and exploit.

 KING. What's he comes here?

 Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

 FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,

 Young Bertram.

 KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;

 Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,

 Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts

 Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.

 BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.

 KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now,

 As when thy father and myself in friendship

 First tried our soldiership. He did look far

 Into the service of the time, and was

 Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;

 But on us both did haggish age steal on,

 And wore us out of act. It much repairs me

 To talk of your good father. In his youth

 He had the wit which I can well observe

 To-day in our young lords; but they may jest

 Till their own scorn return to them unnoted

 Ere they can hide their levity in honour.

 So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness

 Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,

 His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,

 Clock to itself, knew the true minute when

 Exception bid him speak, and at this time

 His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him

 He us'd as creatures of another place;

 And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,

 Making them proud of his humility

 In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man

 Might be a copy to these younger times;

 Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now

 But goers backward.

 BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,

 Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;

 So in approof lives not his epitaph

 As in your royal speech.

 KING. Would I were with him! He would always sayMethinks

 I hear him now; his plausive words

 He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them

 To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-

 This his good melancholy oft began,

 On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,

 When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he

 'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff

 Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses

 All but new things disdain; whose judgments are

 Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies

 Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.

 I, after him, do after him wish too,

 Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,

 I quickly were dissolved from my hive,

 To give some labourers room.

 SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir;

 They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

 KING. I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, Count,

 Since the physician at your father's died?

 He was much fam'd.

 BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.

 KING. If he were living, I would try him yetLend

 me an arm-the rest have worn me out

 With several applications. Nature and sickness

 Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;

 My son's no dearer.

 BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty. Exeunt [Flourish]

 ACT I. SCENE 3.

 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

 Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN

 COUNTESS. I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman? STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.

 COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours. CLOWN. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow. COUNTESS. Well, sir.

 CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may. COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

 CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.

 COUNTESS. In what case?

 CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for they say bames are blessings.

 COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

 CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.

 COUNTESS. Is this all your worship's reason?

 CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are. COUNTESS. May the world know them?

 CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent. COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

 CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake.

 COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

 CLOWN. Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i' th' herd.

 COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave? CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:

 

                For I the ballad will repeat,

                  Which men full true shall find:

                Your marriage comes by destiny,

                  Your cuckoo sings by kind.

  

 

 COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon. STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you. Of her I am to speak.

 COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.

 CLOWN. [Sings]

 

                 'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she

                   'Why the Grecians sacked Troy?

                 Fond done, done fond,

                   Was this King Priam's joy?'

                 With that she sighed as she stood,

                 With that she sighed as she stood,

                   And gave this sentence then:

                 'Among nine bad if one be good,

                 Among nine bad if one be good,

                   There's yet one good in ten.'

  

 

 COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah. CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th' song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.

 COUNTESS. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you. CLOWN. That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither. Exit

 COUNTESS. Well, now.

 STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid her than she'll demand.

 STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.

 COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself. Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon. Exit STEWARD

 Enter HELENA

 Even so it was with me when I was young.

 If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn

 Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;

 Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.

 It is the show and seal of nature's truth,

 Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.

 By our remembrances of days foregone,

 Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.

 Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.

 HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?

 COUNTESS. You know, Helen,

 I am a mother to you.

 HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.

 COUNTESS. Nay, a mother.

 Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'

 Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'

 That you start at it? I say I am your mother,

 And put you in the catalogue of those

 That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen

 Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds

 A native slip to us from foreign seeds.

 You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,

 Yet I express to you a mother's care.

 God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood

 To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,

 That this distempered messenger of wet,

 The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?

 Why, that you are my daughter?

 HELENA. That I am not.

 COUNTESS. I say I am your mother.

 HELENA. Pardon, madam.

 The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:

 I am from humble, he from honoured name;

 No note upon my parents, his all noble.

 My master, my dear lord he is; and I

 His servant live, and will his vassal die.

 He must not be my brother.

 COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?

 HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you wereSo

 that my lord your son were not my brotherIndeed

 my mother! Or were you both our mothers,

 I care no more for than I do for heaven,

 So I were not his sister. Can't no other,

 But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?

 COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.

 God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'

 So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?

 My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see

 The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find

 Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross

 You love my son; invention is asham'd,

 Against the proclamation of thy passion,

 To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;

 But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks

 Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes

 See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours

 That in their kind they speak it; only sin

 And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,

 That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?

 If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;

 If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,

 As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,

 To tell me truly.

 HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.

 COUNTESS. Do you love my son?

 HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.

 COUNTESS. Love you my son?

 HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?

 COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond

 Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose

 The state of your affection; for your passions

 Have to the full appeach'd.

 HELENA. Then I confess,

 Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,

 That before you, and next unto high heaven,

 I love your son.

 My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.

 Be not offended, for it hurts not him

 That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not

 By any token of presumptuous suit,

 Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;

 Yet never know how that desert should be.

 I know I love in vain, strive against hope;

 Yet in this captious and intenible sieve

 I still pour in the waters of my love,

 And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,

 Religious in mine error, I adore

 The sun that looks upon his worshipper

 But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,

 Let not your hate encounter with my love,

 For loving where you do; but if yourself,

 Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,

 Did ever in so true a flame of liking

 Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian

 Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity

 To her whose state is such that cannot choose

 But lend and give where she is sure to lose;

 That seeks not to find that her search implies,

 But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!

 COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak trulyTo

 go to Paris?

 HELENA. Madam, I had.

 COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.

 HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.

 You know my father left me some prescriptions

 Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading

 And manifest experience had collected

 For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me

 In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,

 As notes whose faculties inclusive were

 More than they were in note. Amongst the rest

 There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,

 To cure the desperate languishings whereof

 The King is render'd lost.

 COUNTESS. This was your motive

 For Paris, was it? Speak.

 HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,

 Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,

 Had from the conversation of my thoughts

 Haply been absent then.

 COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,

 If you should tender your supposed aid,

 He would receive it? He and his physicians

 Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;

 They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit

 A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,

 Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off

 The danger to itself?

 HELENA. There's something in't

 More than my father's skill, which was the great'st

 Of his profession, that his good receipt

 Shall for my legacy be sanctified

 By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour But give me leave to try success, I'd venture

 The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.

 By such a day and hour.

 COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?

 HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.

 COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,

 Means and attendants, and my loving greetings

 To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,

 And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.

 Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,

 What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss. Exeunt

 ACT II. SCENE 1.

 Paris. The KING'S palace

 Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS

 KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles

 Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;

 Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,

 The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,

 And is enough for both.

 FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,

 After well-ent'red soldiers, to return

 And find your Grace in health.

 KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart

 Will not confess he owes the malady

 That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;

 Whether I live or die, be you the sons

 Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher ItalyThose

 bated that inherit but the fall

 Of the last monarchy-see that you come

 Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when

 The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,

 That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.

 SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty! KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;

 They say our French lack language to deny,

 If they demand; beware of being captives

 Before you serve.

 BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.

 KING. Farewell. [To ATTENDANTS] Come hither to me.

 The KING retires attended FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us! PAROLLES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark.

 SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!

 PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.

 BERTRAM. I am commanded here and kept a coil with

 'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'

 PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely. BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,

 Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,

 Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn

 But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.

 FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.

 PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.

 SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.

 BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body. FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.

 SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

 PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me. FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.

 PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices! Exeunt LORDS What will ye do?

 Re-enter the KING

 BERTRAM. Stay; the King!

 PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.

 BERTRAM. And I will do so.

 PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.

 Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES

 Enter LAFEU

 LAFEU. [Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings. KING. I'll fee thee to stand up.

 LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon. I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;

 And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

 KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,

 And ask'd thee mercy for't.

 LAFEU. Good faith, across!

 But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd

 Of your infirmity?

 KING. No.

 LAFEU. O, will you eat

 No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will

 My noble grapes, an if my royal fox

 Could reach them: I have seen a medicine

 That's able to breathe life into a stone,

 Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary

 With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch

 Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,

 To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand

 And write to her a love-line.

 KING. What her is this?

 LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,

 If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,

 If seriously I may convey my thoughts

 In this my light deliverance, I have spoke

 With one that in her sex, her years, profession,

 Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more

 Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,

 For that is her demand, and know her business?

 That done, laugh well at me.

 KING. Now, good Lafeu,

 Bring in the admiration, that we with the

 May spend our wonder too, or take off thine

 By wond'ring how thou took'st it.

 LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,

 And not be all day neither. Exit LAFEU KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

 Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA

 LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.

 KING. This haste hath wings indeed.

 LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;

 This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.

 A traitor you do look like; but such traitors

 His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,

 That dare leave two together. Fare you well. Exit KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

 HELENA. Ay, my good lord.

 Gerard de Narbon was my father,

 In what he did profess, well found.

 KING. I knew him.

 HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;

 Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death

 Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,

 Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,

 And of his old experience th' only darling,

 He bade me store up as a triple eye,

 Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:

 And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd

 With that malignant cause wherein the honour

 Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,

 I come to tender it, and my appliance,

 With all bound humbleness.

 KING. We thank you, maiden;

 But may not be so credulous of cure,

 When our most learned doctors leave us, and

 The congregated college have concluded

 That labouring art can never ransom nature

 From her inaidable estate-I say we must not

 So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,

 To prostitute our past-cure malady

 To empirics; or to dissever so

 Our great self and our credit to esteem

 A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.

 HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.

 I will no more enforce mine office on you;

 Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts

 A modest one to bear me back again.

 KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.

 Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give

 As one near death to those that wish him live.

 But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;

 I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

 HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,

 Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.

 He that of greatest works is finisher

 Oft does them by the weakest minister.

 So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,

 When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown

 From simple sources, and great seas have dried

 When miracles have by the greatest been denied.

 Oft expectation fails, and most oft there

 Where most it promises; and oft it hits

 Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.

 KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;

 Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;

 Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

 HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.

 It is not so with Him that all things knows,

 As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;

 But most it is presumption in us when

 The help of heaven we count the act of men.

 Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;

 Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.

 I am not an impostor, that proclaim

 Myself against the level of mine aim;

 But know I think, and think I know most sure,

 My art is not past power nor you past cure.

 KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space

 Hop'st thou my cure?

 HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.

 Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring

 Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,

 Ere twice in murk and occidental damp

 Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,

 Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass

 Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,

 What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,

 Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.

 KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence

 What dar'st thou venture?

 HELENA. Tax of impudence,

 A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,

 Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name

 Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended

 With vilest torture let my life be ended.

 KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak

 His powerful sound within an organ weak;

 And what impossibility would slay

 In common sense, sense saves another way.

 Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate

 Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:

 Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all

 That happiness and prime can happy call.

 Thou this to hazard needs must intimate

 Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.

 Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,

 That ministers thine own death if I die.

 HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property

 Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;

 And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;

 But, if I help, what do you promise me?

 KING. Make thy demand.

 HELENA. But will you make it even?

 KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.

 HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand

 What husband in thy power I will command.

 Exempted be from me the arrogance

 To choose from forth the royal blood of France,

 My low and humble name to propagate

 With any branch or image of thy state;

 But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know

 Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

 KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,

 Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.

 So make the choice of thy own time, for I,

 Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.

 More should I question thee, and more I must,

 Though more to know could not be more to trust,

 From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest

 Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.

 Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed

 As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.

 [Flourish. Exeunt]

 ACT II. SCENE 2.

 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

 Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN

 COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.

 CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.

 COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

 CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men. COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions. CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock. COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

 CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.

 COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?

 CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.

 COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.

 CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.

 COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

 CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.

 COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you. CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.

 COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat. CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

 COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.

 CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.

 COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

 CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.

 COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,

 To entertain it so merrily with a fool.

 CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.

 COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this, And urge her to a present answer back;

 Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.

 CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?

 COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me? CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.

 COUNTESS. Haste you again. Exeunt

 ACT II. SCENE 3.

 Paris. The KING'S palace

 Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

 LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.

 PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.

 BERTRAM. And so 'tis.

 LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artistsPAROLLES.

 So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.

 LAFEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellowsPAROLLES.

 Right; so I say.

 LAFEU. That gave him out incurablePAROLLES.

 Why, there 'tis; so say I too.

 LAFEU. Not to be help'dPAROLLES.

 Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of aLAFEU.

 Uncertain life and sure death.

 PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.

 LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.

 PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall read it in what-do-ye-call't here.

 LAFEU. [Reading the ballad title] 'A Showing of a Heavenly Effect in an Earthly Actor.'

 PAROLLES. That's it; I would have said the very same.

 LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in respectPAROLLES.

 Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief

 and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be theLAFEU.

 Very hand of heaven.

 PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.

 LAFEU. In a most weakPAROLLES.

 And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;

 which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone the recov'ry of the King, as to beLAFEU.

 Generally thankful.

 Enter KING, HELENA, and ATTENDANTS

 PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King. LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a coranto.

 PAROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?

 LAFEU. 'Fore God, I think so.

 KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.

 Exit an ATTENDANT Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;

 And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense

 Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive

 The confirmation of my promis'd gift,

 Which but attends thy naming.

 Enter three or four LORDS

 Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel

 Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,

 O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice

 I have to use. Thy frank election make;

 Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

 HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress

 Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!

 LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture

 My mouth no more were broken than these boys',

 And writ as little beard.

 KING. Peruse them well.

 Not one of those but had a noble father.

 HELENA. Gentlemen,

 Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.

 ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

 HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest

 That I protest I simply am a maid.

 Please it your Majesty, I have done already.

 The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:

 'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,

 Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,

 We'll ne'er come there again.'

 KING. Make choice and see:

 Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

 HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,

 And to imperial Love, that god most high,

 Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

 FIRST LORD. And grant it.

 HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

 LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.

 HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,

 Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.

 Love make your fortunes twenty times above

 Her that so wishes, and her humble love!

 SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.

 HELENA. My wish receive,

 Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.

 LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of. HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;

 I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.

 Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed

 Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

 LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her. Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em. HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,

 To make yourself a son out of my blood.

 FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.

 LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.

 HELENA. [To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give Me and my service, ever whilst I live,

 Into your guiding power. This is the man.

 KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife. BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness, In such a business give me leave to use

 The help of mine own eyes.

 KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,

 What she has done for me?

 BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;

 But never hope to know why I should marry her.

 KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.

 BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down

 Must answer for your raising? I know her well:

 She had her breeding at my father's charge.

 A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain

 Rather corrupt me ever!

 KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which

 I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,

 Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,

 Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off

 In differences so mighty. If she be

 All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,

 A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st

 Of virtue for the name; but do not so.

 From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,

 The place is dignified by the doer's deed;

 Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,

 It is a dropsied honour. Good alone

 Is good without a name. Vileness is so:

 The property by what it is should go,

 Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;

 In these to nature she's immediate heir;

 And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn

 Which challenges itself as honour's born

 And is not like the sire. Honours thrive

 When rather from our acts we them derive

 Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,

 Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave

 A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb

 Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb

 Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?

 If thou canst like this creature as a maid,

 I can create the rest. Virtue and she

 Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

 BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.

 KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose. HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.

 Let the rest go.

 KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,

 I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,

 Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,

 That dost in vile misprision shackle up

 My love and her desert; that canst not dream

 We, poising us in her defective scale,

 Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know

 It is in us to plant thine honour where

 We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;

 Obey our will, which travails in thy good;

 Believe not thy disdain, but presently

 Do thine own fortunes that obedient right

 Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;

 Or I will throw thee from my care for ever

 Into the staggers and the careless lapse

 Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate

 Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,

 Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.

 BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit

 My fancy to your eyes. When I consider

 What great creation and what dole of honour

 Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late

 Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now

 The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,

 Is as 'twere born so.

 KING. Take her by the hand,

 And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise

 A counterpoise, if not to thy estate

 A balance more replete.

 BERTRAM. I take her hand.

 KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King

 Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony

 Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,

 And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast

 Shall more attend upon the coming space,

 Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,

 Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

 

                Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind,

                                        commenting of this wedding

  

 

 LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.

 PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?

 LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation. PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!

 LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?

 PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master!

 LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

 PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.

 LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style. PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.

 LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.

 PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.

 LAFEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce worth.

 PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon theeLAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.

 PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

 LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

 PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.

 LAFEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.

 PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.

 LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.' PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation. LAFEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave. Exit PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me: scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have ofI' ll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.

 Re-enter LAFEU

 LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for you; you have a new mistress.

 PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve above is my master.

 LAFEU. Who? God?

 PAROLLES. Ay, sir.

 LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

 PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

 LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller; you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you. Exit

 Enter BERTRAM

 PAROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal'd awhile.

 BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

 PAROLLES. What's the matter, sweetheart?

 BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,

 I will not bed her.

 PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?

 BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!

 I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

 PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits

 The tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!

 BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know not yet.

 PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'

 wars!

 He wears his honour in a box unseen

 That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,

 Spending his manly marrow in her arms,

 Which should sustain the bound and high curvet

 Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!

 France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;

 Therefore, to th' war!

 BERTRAM. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,

 Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,

 And wherefore I am fled; write to the King

 That which I durst not speak. His present gift

 Shall furnish me to those Italian fields

 Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife

 To the dark house and the detested wife.

 PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?

 BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.

 I'll send her straight away. To-morrow

 I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

 PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard: A young man married is a man that's marr'd.

 Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.

 The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so. Exeunt

 ACT II. SCENE 4.

 Paris. The KING'S palace

 Enter HELENA and CLOWN

 HELENA. My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

 CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well. HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very well?

 CLOWN. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things. HELENA. What two things?

 CLOWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!

 Enter PAROLLES

 PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!

 HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.

 PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

 CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say.

 PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.

 CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title, which is within a very little of nothing.

 PAROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.

 CLOWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave'; that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir. PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee. CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

 PAROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.

 Madam, my lord will go away to-night:

 A very serious business calls on him.

 The great prerogative and rite of love,

 Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;

 But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;

 Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,

 Which they distil now in the curbed time,

 To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy

 And pleasure drown the brim.

 HELENA. What's his else?

 PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King, And make this haste as your own good proceeding,

 Strength'ned with what apology you think

 May make it probable need.

 HELENA. What more commands he?

 PAROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently

 Attend his further pleasure.

 HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.

 PAROLLES. I shall report it so.

 

    HELENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES

      Come, sirrah.                                         Exeunt

  

 

 ACT II. SCENE 5.

 Paris. The KING'S palace

 Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM

 LAFEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier. BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

 LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance.

 BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.

 LAFEU. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting. BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and accordingly valiant.

 LAFEU. I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you make us friends; I will pursue the amity

 Enter PAROLLES

 PAROLLES. [To BERTRAM] These things shall be done, sir. LAFEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

 PAROLLES. Sir!

 LAFEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a very good tailor.

 BERTRAM. [Aside to PAROLLES] Is she gone to the King?

 PAROLLES. She is.

 BERTRAM. Will she away to-night?

 PAROLLES. As you'll have her.

 BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,

 Given order for our horses; and to-night,

 When I should take possession of the bride,

 End ere I do begin.

 LAFEU. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, Captain.

 BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur? PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure.

 LAFEU. You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence.

 BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

 LAFEU. And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes; trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil. Exit PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.

 BERTRAM. I think so.

 PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?

 BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech

 Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

 Enter HELENA

 HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,

 Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave

 For present parting; only he desires

 Some private speech with you.

 BERTRAM. I shall obey his will.

 You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,

 Which holds not colour with the time, nor does

 The ministration and required office

 On my particular. Prepar'd I was not

 For such a business; therefore am I found

 So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you

 That presently you take your way for home,

 And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;

 For my respects are better than they seem,

 And my appointments have in them a need

 Greater than shows itself at the first view

 To you that know them not. This to my mother.

 [Giving a letter] 'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so

 I leave you to your wisdom.

 HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say

 But that I am your most obedient servant.

 BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.

 HELENA. And ever shall

 With true observance seek to eke out that

 Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd

 To equal my great fortune.

 BERTRAM. Let that go.

 My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.

 HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.

 BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?

 HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,

 Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;

 But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal

 What law does vouch mine own.

 BERTRAM. What would you have?

 HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.

 I would not tell you what I would, my lord.

 Faith, yes:

 Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.

 BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

 HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

 BERTRAM. Where are my other men, monsieur?

 Farewell! Exit HELENA Go thou toward home, where I will never come

 Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.

 Away, and for our flight.

 PAROLLES. Bravely, coragio! Exeunt

 ACT III. SCENE 1.

 Florence. The DUKE's palace

 Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, attended; two

 FRENCH LORDS, with a TROOP OF SOLDIERS

 DUKE. So that, from point to point, now have you hear

 The fundamental reasons of this war;

 Whose great decision hath much blood let forth

 And more thirsts after.

 FIRST LORD. Holy seems the quarrel

 Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful

 On the opposer.

 DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France

 Would in so just a business shut his bosom

 Against our borrowing prayers.

 SECOND LORD. Good my lord,

 The reasons of our state I cannot yield,

 But like a common and an outward man

 That the great figure of a council frames

 By self-unable motion; therefore dare not

 Say what I think of it, since I have found

 Myself in my incertain grounds to fail

 As often as I guess'd.

 DUKE. Be it his pleasure.

 FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature,

 That surfeit on their ease, will day by day

 Come here for physic.

 DUKE. Welcome shall they be

 And all the honours that can fly from us

 Shall on them settle. You know your places well;

 When better fall, for your avails they fell.

 To-morrow to th' field. Flourish. Exeunt

 ACT III. SCENE 2.

 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

 Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN

 COUNTESS. It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he comes not along with her.

 CLOWN. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.

 COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?

 CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.

 COUNTESS. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.

 [Opening a letter] CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out; and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach. COUNTESS. What have we here?

 CLOWN. E'en that you have there. Exit COUNTESS. [Reads] 'I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath recovered the King and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. You shall hear I am run away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.

 

                                             Your unfortunate son,

                                                         BERTRAM.'

  

 

 This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,

 To fly the favours of so good a king,

 To pluck his indignation on thy head

 By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous

 For the contempt of empire.

 Re-enter CLOWN

 CLOWN. O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady.

 COUNTESS. What is the -matter?

 CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.

 COUNTESS. Why should he be kill'd?

 CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my part, I only hear your son was run away. Exit

 Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.

 HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.

 COUNTESS. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemenI

 have felt so many quirks of joy and grief

 That the first face of neither, on the start,

 Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence. We met him thitherward; for thence we came,

 And, after some dispatch in hand at court,

 Thither we bend again.

 HELENA. Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.

 [Reads] 'When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a "then" I write a "never."

 This is a dreadful sentence.

 COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;

 And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.

 COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;

 If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,

 Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;

 But I do wash his name out of my blood,

 And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.

 COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't, The Duke will lay upon him all the honour

 That good convenience claims.

 COUNTESS. Return you thither?

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed. HELENA. [Reads] 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.' 'Tis bitter.

 COUNTESS. Find you that there?

 HELENA. Ay, madam.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which his heart was not consenting to.

 COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife!

 There's nothing here that is too good for him

 But only she; and she deserves a lord

 That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,

 And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman

 Which I have sometime known.

 COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.

 COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.

 My son corrupts a well-derived nature

 With his inducement.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady,

 The fellow has a deal of that too much

 Which holds him much to have.

 COUNTESS. Y'are welcome, gentlemen.

 I will entreat you, when you see my son,

 To tell him that his sword can never win

 The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you

 Written to bear along.

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam,

 In that and all your worthiest affairs.

 COUNTESS. Not so, but as we change our courtesies.

 Will you draw near? Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'

 Nothing in France until he has no wife!

 Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France

 Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't

 That chase thee from thy country, and expose

 Those tender limbs of thine to the event

 Of the non-sparing war? And is it I

 That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou

 Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark

 Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,

 That ride upon the violent speed of fire,

 Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,

 That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.

 Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;

 Whoever charges on his forward breast,

 I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;

 And though I kill him not, I am the cause

 His death was so effected. Better 'twere

 I met the ravin lion when he roar'd

 With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere

 That all the miseries which nature owes

 Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,

 Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,

 As oft it loses all. I will be gone.

 My being here it is that holds thee hence.

 Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although

 The air of paradise did fan the house,

 And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,

 That pitiful rumour may report my flight

 To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.

 For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away. Exit

 ACT III. SCENE 3.

 Florence. Before the DUKE's palace

 Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, SOLDIERS, drum and trumpets

 DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we,

 Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence

 Upon thy promising fortune.

 BERTRAM. Sir, it is

 A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet

 We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake

 To th' extreme edge of hazard.

 DUKE. Then go thou forth;

 And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,

 As thy auspicious mistress!

 BERTRAM. This very day,

 Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;

 Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove

 A lover of thy drum, hater of love. Exeunt

 ACT III. SCENE 4.

 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

 Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD

 COUNTESS. Alas! and would you take the letter of her?

 Might you not know she would do as she has done

 By sending me a letter? Read it again.

 STEWARD. [Reads] 'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone. Ambitious love hath so in me offended

 That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,

 With sainted vow my faults to have amended.

 Write, write, that from the bloody course of war

 My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.

 Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far

 His name with zealous fervour sanctify.

 His taken labours bid him me forgive;

 I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth

 From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,

 Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.

 He is too good and fair for death and me;

 Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'

 COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words! Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much

 As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,

 I could have well diverted her intents,

 Which thus she hath prevented.

 STEWARD. Pardon me, madam;

 If I had given you this at over-night,

 She might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes

 Pursuit would be but vain.

 COUNTESS. What angel shall

 Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,

 Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear

 And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath

 Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,

 To this unworthy husband of his wife;

 Let every word weigh heavy of her worth

 That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,

 Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.

 Dispatch the most convenient messenger.

 When haply he shall hear that she is gone

 He will return; and hope I may that she,

 Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,

 Led hither by pure love. Which of them both

 Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense

 To make distinction. Provide this messenger.

 My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;

 Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak. Exeunt

 ACT III. SCENE 5.

 Without the walls of Florence

 A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CITIZENS

 WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight.

 DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service. WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st commander; and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother. [Tucket] We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you may know by their trumpets.

 MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as honesty.

 WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.

 MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost. DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.

 Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim

 WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her. God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?

 HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.

 Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

 WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.

 HELENA. Is this the way?

 [A march afar] WIDOW. Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.

 If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,

 But till the troops come by,

 I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;

 The rather for I think I know your hostess

 As ample as myself.

 HELENA. Is it yourself?

 WIDOW. If you shall please so, pilgrim.

 HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

 WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?

 HELENA. I did so.

 WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours

 That has done worthy service.

 HELENA. His name, I pray you.

 DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?

 HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;

 His face I know not.

 DIANA. What some'er he is,

 He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,

 As 'tis reported, for the King had married him

 Against his liking. Think you it is so?

 HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.

 DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count

 Reports but coarsely of her.

 HELENA. What's his name?

 DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.

 HELENA. O, I believe with him,

 In argument of praise, or to the worth

 Of the great Count himself, she is too mean

 To have her name repeated; all her deserving

 Is a reserved honesty, and that

 I have not heard examin'd.

 DIANA. Alas, poor lady!

 'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife

 Of a detesting lord.

 WIDOW. I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is

 Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her

 A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.

 HELENA. How do you mean?

 May be the amorous Count solicits her

 In the unlawful purpose.

 WIDOW. He does, indeed;

 And brokes with all that can in such a suit

 Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;

 But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard

 In honestest defence.

 Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the

 whole ARMY

 MARIANA. The gods forbid else!

 WIDOW. So, now they come.

 That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;

 That, Escalus.

 HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?

 DIANA. HeThat

 with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.

 I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester

 He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman?

 HELENA. I like him well.

 DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave That leads him to these places; were I his lady

 I would poison that vile rascal.

 HELENA. Which is he?

 DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy? HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.

 PAROLLES. Lose our drum! well.

 MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at something.

 Look, he has spied us.

 WIDOW. Marry, hang you!

 MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

 Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and ARMY WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents

 There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,

 Already at my house.

 HELENA. I humbly thank you.

 Please it this matron and this gentle maid

 To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking

 Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,

 I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,

 Worthy the note.

 BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly. Exeunt

 ACT III. SCENE 6.

 Camp before Florence

 Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS

 SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way. FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more in your respect.

 SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.

 BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

 SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment.

 FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.

 BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him. FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.

 SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything.

 FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's

 entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.

 Enter PAROLLES

 SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.

 BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.

 FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.

 PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!

 FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the command of the service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.

 BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.

 Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered.

 PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.

 BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.

 PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'

 BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of our worthiness.

 PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

 BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.

 PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.

 BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it? PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.

 BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

 PAROLLES. I love not many words. Exit SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.

 FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him ever after.

 BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

 SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.

 FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night.

 SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught. BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.

 SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'll leave you. Exit BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you

 The lass I spoke of.

 FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest.

 BERTRAM. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once, And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,

 By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,

 Tokens and letters which she did re-send;

 And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;

 Will you go see her?

 FIRST LORD. With all my heart, my lord. Exeunt

 ACT III. SCENE 7.

 Florence. The WIDOW'S house

 Enter HELENA and WIDOW

 HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she,

 I know not how I shall assure you further

 But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

 WIDOW. Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,

 Nothing acquainted with these businesses;

 And would not put my reputation now

 In any staining act.

 HELENA. Nor would I wish you.

 FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband,

 And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken

 Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,

 By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,

 Err in bestowing it.

 WIDOW. I should believe you;

 For you have show'd me that which well approves

 Y'are great in fortune.

 HELENA. Take this purse of gold,

 And let me buy your friendly help thus far,

 Which I will over-pay and pay again

 When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter

 Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,

 Resolv'd to carry her. Let her in fine consent,

 As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.

 Now his important blood will nought deny

 That she'll demand. A ring the County wears

 That downward hath succeeded in his house

 From son to son some four or five descents

 Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds

 In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,

 To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,

 Howe'er repented after.

 WIDOW. Now I see

 The bottom of your purpose.

 HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more

 But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,

 Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;

 In fine, delivers me to fill the time,

 Herself most chastely absent. After this,

 To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns

 To what is pass'd already.

 WIDOW. I have yielded.

 Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,

 That time and place with this deceit so lawful

 May prove coherent. Every night he comes

 With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd

 To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us

 To chide him from our eaves, for he persists

 As if his life lay on 't.

 HELENA. Why then to-night

 Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,

 Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,

 And lawful meaning in a lawful act;

 Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.

 But let's about it. Exeunt

 ACT IV. SCENE 1.

 Without the Florentine camp

 Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six other SOLDIERS in ambush

 SECOND LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will; though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we must produce for an interpreter.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.

 SECOND LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice? FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I warrant you.

 SECOND LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again? FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you speak to me.

 SECOND LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i' th' adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all

 neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

 Enter PAROLLES

 PAROLLES. Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me; and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.

 SECOND LORD. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of.

 PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it. They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.

 SECOND LORD. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?

 PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.

 SECOND LORD. We cannot afford you so.

 PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in stratagem.

 SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do.

 PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd. SECOND LORD. Hardly serve.

 PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadelSECOND LORD. How deep?

 PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.

 SECOND LORD. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed. PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I recover'd it.

 SECOND LORD. You shall hear one anon. [Alarum within] PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!

 SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.

 ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.

 PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.

 [They blindfold him] FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.

 PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,

 And I shall lose my life for want of language.

 If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,

 Italian, or French, let him speak to me;

 I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.

 PAROLLES. O!

 FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche. SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.

 FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;

 And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on

 To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform

 Something to save thy life.

 PAROLLES. O, let me live,

 And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,

 Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that

 Which you will wonder at.

 FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?

 PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.

 Come on; thou art granted space.

 Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother

 We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled

 Till we do hear from them.

 SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.

 SECOND LORD. 'A will betray us all unto ourselvesInform

 on that.

 SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.

 SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.

 Exeunt

 ACT IV. SCENE 2.

 Florence. The WIDOW'S house

 Enter BERTRAM and DIANA

 BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.

 DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.

 BERTRAM. Titled goddess;

 And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,

 In your fine frame hath love no quality?

 If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,

 You are no maiden, but a monument;

 When you are dead, you should be such a one

 As you are now, for you are cold and stern;

 And now you should be as your mother was

 When your sweet self was got.

 DIANA. She then was honest.

 BERTRAM. So should you be.

 DIANA. No.

 My mother did but duty; such, my lord,

 As you owe to your wife.

 BERTRAM. No more o'that!

 I prithee do not strive against my vows.

 I was compell'd to her; but I love the

 By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever

 Do thee all rights of service.

 DIANA. Ay, so you serve us

 Till we serve you; but when you have our roses

 You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,

 And mock us with our bareness.

 BERTRAM. How have I sworn!

 DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,

 But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.

 What is not holy, that we swear not by,

 But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me: If I should swear by Jove's great attributes

 I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths

 When I did love you ill? This has no holding,

 To swear by him whom I protest to love

 That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths

 Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'dAt

 least in my opinion.

 BERTRAM. Change it, change it;

 Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;

 And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts

 That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,

 But give thyself unto my sick desires,

 Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever

 My love as it begins shall so persever.

 DIANA. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre

 That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

 BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power

 To give it from me.

 DIANA. Will you not, my lord?

 BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,

 Bequeathed down from many ancestors;

 Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world

 In me to lose.

 DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:

 My chastity's the jewel of our house,

 Bequeathed down from many ancestors;

 Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world

 In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom

 Brings in the champion Honour on my part

 Against your vain assault.

 BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;

 My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,

 And I'll be bid by thee.

 DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;

 I'll order take my mother shall not hear.

 Now will I charge you in the band of truth,

 When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,

 Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:

 My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them

 When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.

 And on your finger in the night I'll put

 Another ring, that what in time proceeds

 May token to the future our past deeds.

 Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won

 A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

 BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

 Exit

 DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!

 You may so in the end.

 My mother told me just how he would woo,

 As if she sat in's heart; she says all men

 Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me

 When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him

 When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,

 Marry that will, I live and die a maid.

 Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin

 To cozen him that would unjustly win. Exit

 ACT IV. SCENE 3.

 The Florentine camp

 Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS

 SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's letter?

 FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd almost into another man.

 SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.

 FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.

 SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave of it.

 FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.

 SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!

 FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows himself.

 SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night? FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour. SECOND LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit. FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.

 SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars? FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.

 SECOND LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

 FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France?

 SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his counsel.

 FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.

 SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.

 FIRST LORD. How is this justified?

 SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.

 FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?

 SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.

 FIRST LORD. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this. SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!

 FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample. SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by our virtues.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 How now? Where's your master?

 SERVANT. He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken a solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France. The Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King. SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.

 FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness. Here's his lordship now.

 Enter BERTRAM

 How now, my lord, is't not after midnight?

 BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.

 SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship. BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier.

 SECOND LORD. Bring him forth. [Exeunt SOLDIERS] Has sat i' th' stocks all night, poor gallant knave.

 BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?

 SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th' stocks. And what think you he hath confess'd?

 BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?

 SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it.

 

                     Enter PAROLLES guarded, and

                    FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter

  

 

 BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me. SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.

 FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without 'em?

 PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.

 SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.

 FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.

 PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.

 FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is strong.' What say you to that?

 PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable. The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live. FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?

 PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you will.

 BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this! SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.

 FIRST LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.

 PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.

 SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this.

 BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it. PAROLLES. 'Poor rogues' I pray you say.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.

 PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are marvellous poor.

 FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.' What say you to that?

 PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each; so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces.

 BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?

 SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say you to this? What do you know of it?

 PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories. Demand them singly.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?

 PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child-a dumb innocent that could not say him nay.

 BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's camp?

 PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.

 SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.

 FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?

 PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band. I think I have his letter in my pocket.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.

 PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent. FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you? PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.

 BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.

 SECOND LORD. Excellently.

 FIRST SOLDIER. [Reads] 'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of gold.'

 PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an

 advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.

 PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.

 BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!

 FIRST SOLDIER. [Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;

 After he scores, he never pays the score.

 Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;

 He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.

 And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:

 Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;

 For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,

 Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.

 Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,

 PAROLLES.' BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's forehead.

 FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.

 BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.

 FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be fain to hang you.

 PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th' stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.

 FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his honesty?

 PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool. Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have he has nothing.

 SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this.

 BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For me, he's more and more a cat.

 FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?

 PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his soldier-ship I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of this I am not certain.

 SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.

 BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat still.

 FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.

 PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually. FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain? FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?

 FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?

 PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry, in coming on he has the cramp.

 FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?

 PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon. FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his pleasure.

 PAROLLES. [Aside] I'll no more drumming. A plague of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken? FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.

 PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death! FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. [Unmuffling him] So look about you; know you any here? BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.

 FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.

 SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.

 FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am for France.

 SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.

 Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that has a knot on 't yet.

 PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?

 FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of you there. Exit with SOLDIERS PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,

 'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;

 But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft

 As captain shall. Simply the thing I am

 Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,

 Let him fear this; for it will come to pass

 That every braggart shall be found an ass.

 Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live

 Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.

 There's place and means for every man alive.

 I'll after them. Exit

 ACT IV SCENE 4.

 The WIDOW'S house

 Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA

 HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you! One of the greatest in the Christian world

 Shall be my surety; fore whose throne 'tis needful,

 Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.

 Time was I did him a desired office,

 Dear almost as his life; which gratitude

 Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,

 And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd

 His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place

 We have convenient convoy. You must know

 I am supposed dead. The army breaking,

 My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,

 And by the leave of my good lord the King,

 We'll be before our welcome.

 WIDOW. Gentle madam,

 You never had a servant to whose trust

 Your business was more welcome.

 HELENA. Nor you, mistress,

 Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour

 To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven

 Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,

 As it hath fated her to be my motive

 And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!

 That can such sweet use make of what they hate,

 When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts

 Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play

 With what it loathes, for that which is away.

 But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,

 Under my poor instructions yet must suffer

 Something in my behalf.

 DIANA. Let death and honesty

 Go with your impositions, I am yours

 Upon your will to suffer.

 HELENA. Yet, I pray you:

 But with the word the time will bring on summer,

 When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns

 And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;

 Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.

 All's Well that Ends Well. Still the fine's the crown.

 Whate'er the course, the end is the renown. Exeunt

 ACT IV SCENE 5.

 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

 Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN

 LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak of.

 COUNTESS. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother. I could not have owed her a more rooted love.

 LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand sallets ere we light on such another herb.

 CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or, rather, the herb of grace.

 LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs. CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.

 LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool? CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's. LAFEU. Your distinction?

 CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service. LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

 CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service. LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool. CLOWN. At your service.

 LAFEU. No, no, no.

 CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are.

 LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?

 CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more hotter in France than there.

 LAFEU. What prince is that?

 CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias, the devil.

 LAFEU. Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.

 CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire. LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.

 CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades' tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature. Exit

 LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.

 COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much sport out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.

 LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?

 COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily effected.

 LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd. COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together. LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.

 COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.

 LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my God, it holds yet.

 Re-enter CLOWN

 CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare. LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of honour; so belike is that.

 CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face.

 LAFEU. Let us go see your son, I pray you;

 I long to talk with the young noble soldier.

 CLOWN. Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.

 ACT V. SCENE 1.

 Marseilles. A street

 Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA, with two ATTENDANTS

 HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and night

 Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.

 But since you have made the days and nights as one,

 To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,

 Be bold you do so grow in my requital

 As nothing can unroot you.

 Enter a GENTLEMAN

 In happy time!

 This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,

 If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.

 GENTLEMAN. And you.

 HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

 GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.

 HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n

 From the report that goes upon your goodness;

 And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,

 Which lay nice manners by, I put you to

 The use of your own virtues, for the which

 I shall continue thankful.

 GENTLEMAN. What's your will?

 HELENA. That it will please you

 To give this poor petition to the King;

 And aid me with that store of power you have

 To come into his presence.

 GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.

 HELENA. Not here, sir?

 GENTLEMAN. Not indeed.

 He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste

 Than is his use.

 WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!

 HELENA. All's Well That Ends Well yet,

 Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.

 I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

 GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;

 Whither I am going.

 HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,

 Since you are like to see the King before me,

 Commend the paper to his gracious hand;

 Which I presume shall render you no blame,

 But rather make you thank your pains for it.

 I will come after you with what good speed

 Our means will make us means.

 GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.

 HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,

 Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again;

 Go, go, provide. Exeunt

 ACT V SCENE 2.

 Rousillon. The inner court of the COUNT'S palace

 Enter CLOWN and PAROLLES

 PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in Fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.

 CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.

 PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by a metaphor.

 CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.

 PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

 CLOWN. Foh! prithee stand away. A paper from Fortune's close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.

 Enter LAFEU

 Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not a musk-cat, that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship. Exit

 PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd. LAFEU. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for other business.

 PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word. LAFEU. You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your word.

 PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

 LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your hand. How does your drum?

 PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me. LAFEU. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee. PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out.

 LAFEU. Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the other brings thee out. [Trumpets sound] The King's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat. Go to; follow.

 PAROLLES. I praise God for you. Exeunt

 ACT V SCENE 3.

 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

 Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with ATTENDANTS

 KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem

 Was made much poorer by it; but your son,

 As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know

 Her estimation home.

 COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;

 And I beseech your Majesty to make it

 Natural rebellion, done i' th' blaze of youth,

 When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,

 O'erbears it and burns on.

 KING. My honour'd lady,

 I have forgiven and forgotten all;

 Though my revenges were high bent upon him

 And watch'd the time to shoot.

 LAFEU. This I must sayBut

 first, I beg my pardon: the young lord

 Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady,

 Offence of mighty note; but to himself

 The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife

 Whose beauty did astonish the survey

 Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;

 Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve

 Humbly call'd mistress.

 KING. Praising what is lost

 Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;

 We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill

 All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;

 The nature of his great offence is dead,

 And deeper than oblivion do we bury

 Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,

 A stranger, no offender; and inform him

 So 'tis our will he should.

 GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege. Exit GENTLEMAN KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?

 LAFEU. All that he is hath reference to your Highness.

 KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me

 That sets him high in fame.

 Enter BERTRAM

 LAFEU. He looks well on 't.

 KING. I am not a day of season,

 For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail

 In me at once. But to the brightest beams

 Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;

 The time is fair again.

 BERTRAM. My high-repented blames,

 Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

 KING. All is whole;

 Not one word more of the consumed time.

 Let's take the instant by the forward top;

 For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees

 Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time

 Steals ere we can effect them. You remember

 The daughter of this lord?

 BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first

 I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart

 Durst make too bold herald of my tongue;

 Where the impression of mine eye infixing,

 Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,

 Which warp'd the line of every other favour,

 Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n,

 Extended or contracted all proportions

 To a most hideous object. Thence it came

 That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,

 Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye

 The dust that did offend it.

 KING. Well excus'd.

 That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away

 From the great compt; but love that comes too late,

 Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,

 To the great sender turns a sour offence,

 Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults

 Make trivial price of serious things we have,

 Not knowing them until we know their grave.

 Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,

 Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;

 Our own love waking cries to see what's done,

 While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.

 Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.

 Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.

 The main consents are had; and here we'll stay

 To see our widower's second marriage-day.

 COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless! Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

 LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name

 Must be digested; give a favour from you,

 To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,

 That she may quickly come.

 [BERTRAM gives a ring] By my old beard,

 And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,

 Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,

 The last that e'er I took her leave at court,

 I saw upon her finger.

 BERTRAM. Hers it was not.

 KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,

 While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.

 This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen

 I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood

 Necessitied to help, that by this token

 I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her

 Of what should stead her most?

 BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,

 Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,

 The ring was never hers.

 COUNTESS. Son, on my life,

 I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it

 At her life's rate.

 LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.

 BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.

 In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,

 Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name

 Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought

 I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd

 To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully

 I could not answer in that course of honour

 As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,

 In heavy satisfaction, and would never

 Receive the ring again.

 KING. Plutus himself,

 That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,

 Hath not in nature's mystery more science

 Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,

 Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know

 That you are well acquainted with yourself,

 Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement

 You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety

 That she would never put it from her finger

 Unless she gave it to yourself in bedWhere

 you have never come- or sent it us

 Upon her great disaster.

 BERTRAM. She never saw it.

 KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;

 And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me

 Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove

 That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.

 And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,

 And she is dead; which nothing, but to close

 Her eyes myself, could win me to believe

 More than to see this ring. Take him away.

 [GUARDS seize BERTRAM] My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,

 Shall tax my fears of little vanity,

 Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him.

 We'll sift this matter further.

 BERTRAM. If you shall prove

 This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy

 Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,

 Where she yet never was. Exit, guarded KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

 Enter a GENTLEMAN

 GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign,

 Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:

 Here's a petition from a Florentine,

 Who hath, for four or five removes, come short

 To tender it herself. I undertook it,

 Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech

 Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,

 Is here attending; her business looks in her

 With an importing visage; and she told me

 In a sweet verbal brief it did concern

 Your Highness with herself.

 KING. [Reads the letter] 'Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.

 DIANA CAPILET.' LAFEU. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I'll none of him.

 KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu,

 To bring forth this discov'ry. Seek these suitors.

 Go speedily, and bring again the Count.

 Exeunt ATTENDANTS I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,

 Was foully snatch'd.

 COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!

 Enter BERTRAM, guarded

 KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you.

 And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,

 Yet you desire to marry.

 Enter WIDOW and DIANA What woman's that?

 DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,

 Derived from the ancient Capilet.

 My suit, as I do understand, you know,

 And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

 WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour

 Both suffer under this complaint we bring,

 And both shall cease, without your remedy.

 KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women?

 BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny

 But that I know them. Do they charge me further?

 DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

 BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.

 DIANA. If you shall marry,

 You give away this hand, and that is mine;

 You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;

 You give away myself, which is known mine;

 For I by vow am so embodied yours

 That she which marries you must marry me,

 Either both or none.

 LAFEU. [To BERTRAM] Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.

 BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature

 Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness

 Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour

 Than for to think that I would sink it here.

 KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend

 Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honour

 Than in my thought it lies!

 DIANA. Good my lord,

 Ask him upon his oath if he does think

 He had not my virginity.

 KING. What say'st thou to her?

 BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,

 And was a common gamester to the camp.

 DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so

 He might have bought me at a common price.

 Do not believe him. o, behold this ring,

 Whose high respect and rich validity

 Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,

 He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,

 If I be one.

 COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.

 Of six preceding ancestors, that gem

 Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue,

 Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:

 That ring's a thousand proofs.

 KING. Methought you said

 You saw one here in court could witness it.

 DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce

 So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.

 LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

 KING. Find him, and bring him hither. Exit an ATTENDANT BERTRAM. What of him?

 He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,

 With all the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd,

 Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.

 Am I or that or this for what he'll utter

 That will speak anything?

 KING. She hath that ring of yours.

 BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,

 And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.

 She knew her distance, and did angle for me,

 Madding my eagerness with her restraint,

 As all impediments in fancy's course

 Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,

 Her infinite cunning with her modern grace

 Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;

 And I had that which any inferior might

 At market-price have bought.

 DIANA. I must be patient.

 You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife

 May justly diet me. I pray you yetSince

 you lack virtue, I will lose a husbandSend

 for your ring, I will return it home,

 And give me mine again.

 BERTRAM. I have it not.

 KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?

 DIANA. Sir, much like

 The same upon your finger.

 KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.

 DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.

 KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him

 Out of a casement.

 DIANA. I have spoke the truth.

 Enter PAROLLES

 BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

 KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.

 Is this the man you speak of?

 DIANA. Ay, my lord.

 KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,

 Not fearing the displeasure of your master,

 Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep offBy

 him and by this woman here what know you?

 PAROLLES. So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have. KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman? PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

 KING. How, I pray you?

 PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman. KING. How is that?

 PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.

 KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.

 What an equivocal companion is this!

 PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command. LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

 DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me marriage?

 PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

 KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?

 PAROLLES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.

 KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside.

 This ring, you say, was yours?

 DIANA. Ay, my good lord.

 KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?

 DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

 KING. Who lent it you?

 DIANA. It was not lent me neither.

 KING. Where did you find it then?

 DIANA. I found it not.

 KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways,

 How could you give it him?

 DIANA. I never gave it him.

 LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at pleasure.

 KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.

 DIANA. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

 KING. Take her away, I do not like her now;

 To prison with her. And away with him.

 Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,

 Thou diest within this hour.

 DIANA. I'll never tell you.

 KING. Take her away.

 DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.

 KING. I think thee now some common customer.

 DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

 KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?

 DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.

 He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:

 I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.

 Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;

 I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

 [Pointing to LAFEU] KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.

 DIANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;

 Exit WIDOW The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,

 And he shall surety me. But for this lord

 Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,

 Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.

 He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;

 And at that time he got his wife with child.

 Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;

 So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quickAnd

 now behold the meaning.

 Re-enter WIDOW with HELENA

 KING. Is there no exorcist

 Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?

 Is't real that I see?

 HELENA. No, my good lord;

 'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,

 The name and not the thing.

 BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon!

 HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,

 I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,

 And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:

 'When from my finger you can get this ring,

 And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.

 Will you be mine now you are doubly won?

 BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

 HELENA. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue,

 Deadly divorce step between me and you!

 O my dear mother, do I see you living?

 LAFEU. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [To PAROLLES] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I

 thank thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee; let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.

 KING. Let us from point to point this story know,

 To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

 [To DIANA] If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower, Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;

 For I can guess that by thy honest aid

 Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.-

 Of that and all the progress, more and less,

 Resolvedly more leisure shall express.

 All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,

 The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. [Flourish]

 EPILOGUE

 EPILOGUE.

 KING. The King's a beggar, now the play is done.

 All is well ended if this suit be won,

 That you express content; which we will pay

 With strife to please you, day exceeding day.

 Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;

 Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

 Exeunt omnes

 SCENE:

 The Roman Empire

 ACT I. SCENE I.

 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

 Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO

 PHILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's

 O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,

 That o'er the files and musters of the war

 Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,

 The office and devotion of their view

 Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,

 Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst

 The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,

 And is become the bellows and the fan

 To cool a gipsy's lust.

 Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train,

 with eunuchs fanning her

 Look where they come!

 Take but good note, and you shall see in him

 The triple pillar of the world transform'd

 Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.

 CLEOPATRA. If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

 ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd. CLEOPATRA. I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.

 ANTONY. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. News, my good lord, from Rome.

 ANTONY. Grates me the sum.

 CLEOPATRA. Nay, hear them, Antony.

 Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows

 If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent

 His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;

 Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;

 Perform't, or else we damn thee.'

 ANTONY. How, my love?

 CLEOPATRA. Perchance? Nay, and most like,

 You must not stay here longer; your dismission

 Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.

 Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?

 Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,

 Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine

 Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame

 When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

 ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch

 Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.

 Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike

 Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life

 Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair

 And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,

 On pain of punishment, the world to weet

 We stand up peerless.

 CLEOPATRA. Excellent falsehood!

 Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?

 I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony

 Will be himself.

 ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.

 Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,

 Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;

 There's not a minute of our lives should stretch

 Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?

 CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.

 ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!

 Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,

 To weep; whose every passion fully strives

 To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.

 No messenger but thine, and all alone

 To-night we'll wander through the streets and note

 The qualities of people. Come, my queen;

 Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.

 Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?

 PHILO. Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,

 He comes too short of that great property

 Which still should go with Antony.

 DEMETRIUS. I am full sorry

 That he approves the common liar, who

 Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope

 Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy! Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

 Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SOOTHSAYER

 CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must charge his horns with garlands!

 ALEXAS. Soothsayer!

 SOOTHSAYER. Your will?

 CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things? SOOTHSAYER. In nature's infinite book of secrecy

 A little I can read.

 ALEXAS. Show him your hand.

 Enter ENOBARBUS

 ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough

 Cleopatra's health to drink.

 CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.

 SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.

 CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.

 SOOTHSAYER. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

 CHARMIAN. He means in flesh.

 IRAS. No, you shall paint when you are old.

 CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!

 ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.

 CHARMIAN. Hush!

 SOOTHSAYER. You shall be more beloving than beloved.

 CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

 ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.

 CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress. SOOTHSAYER. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

 CHARMIAN. O, excellent! I love long life better than figs. SOOTHSAYER. You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach.

 CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.

 Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

 SOOTHSAYER. If every of your wishes had a womb,

 And fertile every wish, a million.

 CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

 ALEXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes. CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

 ALEXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.

 ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall bedrunk to bed.

 IRAS. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

 CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine. IRAS. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

 CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune. SOOTHSAYER. Your fortunes are alike.

 IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particulars.

 SOOTHSAYER. I have said.

 IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

 CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?

 IRAS. Not in my husband's nose.

 CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!

 IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

 CHARMIAN. Amen.

 ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!

 Enter CLEOPATRA

 ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here comes Antony.

 CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.

 CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?

 ENOBARBUS. No, lady.

 CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?

 CHARMIAN. No, madam.

 CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden

 A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

 ENOBARBUS. Madam?

 CLEOPATRA. Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas? ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

 Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants

 CLEOPATRA. We will not look upon him. Go with us.

 Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

 ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?

 MESSENGER. Ay.

 But soon that war had end, and the time's state

 Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar, Whose better issue in the war from Italy

 Upon the first encounter drave them.

 ANTONY. Well, what worst?

 MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller.

 ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!

 Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:

 Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,

 I hear him as he flatter'd.

 MESSENGER. LabienusThis

 is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force

 Extended Asia from Euphrates,

 His conquering banner shook from Syria

 To Lydia and to Ionia,

 WhilstANTONY.

 Antony, thou wouldst say.

 MESSENGER. O, my lord!

 ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;

 Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.

 Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults

 With such full licence as both truth and malice

 Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds

 When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us

 Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

 MESSENGER. At your noble pleasure. Exit ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

 FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one? SECOND ATTENDANT. He stays upon your will.

 ANTONY. Let him appear.

 These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,

 Or lose myself in dotage.

 Enter another MESSENGER with a letter

 What are you?

 SECOND MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead.

 ANTONY. Where died she?

 SECOND MESSENGER. In Sicyon.

 Her length of sickness, with what else more serious

 Importeth thee to know, this bears. [Gives the letter] ANTONY. Forbear me. Exit MESSENGER There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.

 What our contempts doth often hurl from us

 We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,

 By revolution low'ring, does become

 The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;

 The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.

 I must from this enchanting queen break off.

 Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,

 My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!

 Re-enter ENOBARBUS

 ENOBARBUS. What's your pleasure, sir?

 ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.

 ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

 ANTONY. I must be gone.

 ENOBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.

 ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.

 ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.

 ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!

 ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.

 ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.

 ENOBARBUS. Sir?

 ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.

 ENOBARBUS. Fulvia?

 ANTONY. Dead.

 ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow. ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state

 Cannot endure my absence.

 ENOBARBUS. And the business you have broach'd here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.

 ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers

 Have notice what we purpose. I shall break

 The cause of our expedience to the Queen,

 And get her leave to part. For not alone

 The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,

 Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to

 Of many our contriving friends in Rome

 Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius

 Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands

 The empire of the sea; our slippery people,

 Whose love is never link'd to the deserver

 Till his deserts are past, begin to throw

 Pompey the Great and all his dignities

 Upon his son; who, high in name and power,

 Higher than both in blood and life, stands up

 For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,

 The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding

 Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life

 And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,

 To such whose place is under us, requires

 Our quick remove from hence.

 ENOBARBUS. I shall do't. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

 CLEOPATRA. Where is he?

 CHARMIAN. I did not see him since.

 CLEOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does. I did not send you. If you find him sad,

 Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report

 That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return. Exit ALEXAS CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,

 You do not hold the method to enforce

 The like from him.

 CLEOPATRA. What should I do I do not?

 CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing. CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him. CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;

 In time we hate that which we often fear.

 Enter ANTONY

 But here comes Antony.

 CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.

 ANTONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purposeCLEOPATRA.

 Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.

 It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature

 Will not sustain it.

 ANTONY. Now, my dearest queenCLEOPATRA.

 Pray you, stand farther from me.

 ANTONY. What's the matter?

 CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news. What says the married woman? You may go.

 Would she had never given you leave to come!

 Let her not say 'tis I that keep you hereI

 have no power upon you; hers you are.

 ANTONY. The gods best knowCLEOPATRA.

 O, never was there queen

 So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first

 I saw the treasons planted.

 ANTONY. CleopatraCLEOPATRA.

 Why should I think you can be mine and true,

 Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,

 Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,

 To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,

 Which break themselves in swearing!

 ANTONY. Most sweet queenCLEOPATRA.

 Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,

 But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,

 Then was the time for words. No going then!

 Eternity was in our lips and eyes,

 Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor

 But was a race of heaven. They are so still,

 Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,

 Art turn'd the greatest liar.

 ANTONY. How now, lady!

 CLEOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know

 There were a heart in Egypt.

 ANTONY. Hear me, queen:

 The strong necessity of time commands

 Our services awhile; but my full heart

 Remains in use with you. Our Italy

 Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius

 Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;

 Equality of two domestic powers

 Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength, Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,

 Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace

 Into the hearts of such as have not thrived

 Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;

 And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge

 By any desperate change. My more particular,

 And that which most with you should safe my going,

 Is Fulvia's death.

 CLEOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,

 It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?

 ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.

 Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read

 The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.

 See when and where she died.

 CLEOPATRA. O most false love!

 Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill

 With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,

 In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.

 ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know

 The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,

 As you shall give th' advice. By the fire

 That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence

 Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war

 As thou affects.

 CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!

 But let it be; I am quickly ill and wellSo

 Antony loves.

 ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,

 And give true evidence to his love, which stands

 An honourable trial.

 CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.

 I prithee turn aside and weep for her;

 Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears

 Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene

 Of excellent dissembling, and let it look

 Like perfect honour.

 ANTONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.

 CLEOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

 ANTONY. Now, by my swordCLEOPATRA.

 And target. Still he mends;

 But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,

 How this Herculean Roman does become

 The carriage of his chafe.

 ANTONY. I'll leave you, lady.

 CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.

 Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.

 Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.

 That you know well. Something it is I wouldO,

 my oblivion is a very Antony,

 And I am all forgotten!

 ANTONY. But that your royalty

 Holds idleness your subject, I should take you

 For idleness itself.

 CLEOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour

 To bear such idleness so near the heart

 As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;

 Since my becomings kill me when they do not

 Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;

 Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,

 And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword

 Sit laurel victory, and smooth success

 Be strew'd before your feet!

 ANTONY. Let us go. Come.

 Our separation so abides and flies

 That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,

 And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.

 Away! Exeunt

 SCENE IV.

 Rome. CAESAR'S house

 Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter; LEPIDUS, and their train

 CAESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,

 It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate

 Our great competitor. From Alexandria

 This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes

 The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike

 Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy

 More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or

 Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults

 That all men follow.

 LEPIDUS. I must not think there are

 Evils enow to darken all his goodness.

 His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,

 More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary

 Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change

 Than what he chooses.

 CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not

 Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,

 To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit

 And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,

 To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet

 With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes himAs

 his composure must be rare indeed

 Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony

 No way excuse his foils when we do bear

 So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd

 His vacancy with his voluptuousness,

 Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones

 Call on him for't! But to confound such time

 That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud

 As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid

 As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,

 Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,

 And so rebel to judgment.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 LEPIDUS. Here's more news.

 MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,

 Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report

 How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,

 And it appears he is belov'd of those

 That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports

 The discontents repair, and men's reports

 Give him much wrong'd.

 CAESAR. I should have known no less.

 It hath been taught us from the primal state

 That he which is was wish'd until he were;

 And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,

 Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,

 Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,

 Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,

 To rot itself with motion.

 MESSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word

 Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,

 Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound

 With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads

 They make in Italy; the borders maritime

 Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.

 No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon

 Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more

 Than could his war resisted.

 CAESAR. Antony,

 Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once

 Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st

 Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel

 Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,

 Though daintily brought up, with patience more

 Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink

 The stale of horses and the gilded puddle

 Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign

 The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;

 Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,

 The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps

 It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,

 Which some did die to look on. And all thisIt

 wounds thine honour that I speak it nowWas

 borne so like a soldier that thy cheek

 So much as lank'd not.

 LEPIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.

 CAESAR. Let his shames quickly

 Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain

 Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end

 Assemble we immediate council. Pompey

 Thrives in our idleness.

 LEPIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,

 I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly

 Both what by sea and land I can be able

 To front this present time.

 CAESAR. Till which encounter

 It is my business too. Farewell.

 LEPIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime

 Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,

 To let me be partaker.

 CAESAR. Doubt not, sir;

 I knew it for my bond. Exeunt

 SCENE V.

 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

 CLEOPATRA. Charmian!

 CHARMIAN. Madam?

 CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha!

 Give me to drink mandragora.

 CHARMIAN. Why, madam?

 CLEOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time

 My Antony is away.

 CHARMIAN. You think of him too much.

 CLEOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!

 CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.

 CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!

 MARDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?

 CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure

 In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee

 That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts

 May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

 MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.

 CLEOPATRA. Indeed?

 MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing

 But what indeed is honest to be done.

 Yet have I fierce affections, and think

 What Venus did with Mars.

 CLEOPATRA. O Charmian,

 Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?

 Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?

 O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!

 Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?

 The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm

 And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,

 Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'

 For so he calls me. Now I feed myself

 With most delicious poison. Think on me,

 That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,

 And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,

 When thou wast here above the ground, I was

 A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey

 Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;

 There would he anchor his aspect and die

 With looking on his life.

 Enter ALEXAS

 ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

 CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!

 Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath

 With his tinct gilded thee.

 How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

 ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,

 He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kissesThis

 orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

 CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.

 ALEXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he

 'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends

 This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,

 To mend the petty present, I will piece

 Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,

 Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,

 And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,

 Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke

 Was beastly dumb'd by him.

 CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?

 ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.

 CLEOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,

 Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!

 He was not sad, for he would shine on those

 That make their looks by his; he was not merry,

 Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay

 In Egypt with his joy; but between both.

 O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,

 The violence of either thee becomes,

 So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?

 ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.

 Why do you send so thick?

 CLEOPATRA. Who's born that day

 When I forget to send to Antony

 Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.

 Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,

 Ever love Caesar so?

 CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!

 CLEOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!

 Say 'the brave Antony.'

 CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!

 CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth

 If thou with Caesar paragon again

 My man of men.

 CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,

 I sing but after you.

 CLEOPATRA. My salad days,

 When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,

 To say as I said then. But come, away!

 Get me ink and paper.

 He shall have every day a several greeting,

 Or I'll unpeople Egypt. Exeunt

 ACT II. SCENE I.

 Messina. POMPEY'S house

 Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner

 POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist

 The deeds of justest men.

 MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,

 That what they do delay they not deny.

 POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays

 The thing we sue for.

 MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,

 Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs

 Deny us for our good; so find we profit

 By losing of our prayers.

 POMPEY. I shall do well.

 The people love me, and the sea is mine;

 My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope

 Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony

 In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make

 No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where

 He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,

 Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,

 Nor either cares for him.

 MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus

 Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.

 POMPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.

 MENAS. From Silvius, sir.

 POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,

 Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,

 Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!

 Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;

 Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,

 Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks

 Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,

 That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour

 Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

 Enter VARRIUS

 How now, Varrius!

 VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:

 Mark Antony is every hour in Rome

 Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis

 A space for farther travel.

 POMPEY. I could have given less matter

 A better ear. Menas, I did not think

 This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm

 For such a petty war; his soldiership

 Is twice the other twain. But let us rear

 The higher our opinion, that our stirring

 Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck

 The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.

 MENAS. I cannot hope

 Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.

 His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;

 His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,

 Not mov'd by Antony.

 POMPEY. I know not, Menas,

 How lesser enmities may give way to greater.

 Were't not that we stand up against them all,

 'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;

 For they have entertained cause enough

 To draw their swords. But how the fear of us

 May cement their divisions, and bind up

 The petty difference we yet not know.

 Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands

 Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.

 Come, Menas. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Rome. The house of LEPIDUS

 Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS

 LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,

 And shall become you well, to entreat your captain

 To soft and gentle speech.

 ENOBARBUS. I shall entreat him

 To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,

 Let Antony look over Caesar's head

 And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,

 Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,

 I would not shave't to-day.

 LEPIDUS. 'Tis not a time

 For private stomaching.

 ENOBARBUS. Every time

 Serves for the matter that is then born in't.

 LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.

 ENOBARBUS. Not if the small come first.

 LEPIDUS. Your speech is passion;

 But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes

 The noble Antony.

 Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS

 ENOBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.

 Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA

 ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.

 Hark, Ventidius.

 CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.

 LEPIDUS. Noble friends,

 That which combin'd us was most great, and let not

 A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,

 May it be gently heard. When we debate

 Our trivial difference loud, we do commit

 Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,

 The rather for I earnestly beseech,

 Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,

 Nor curstness grow to th' matter.

 ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.

 Were we before our arinies, and to fight,

 I should do thus. [Flourish] CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.

 ANTONY. Thank you.

 CAESAR. Sit.

 ANTONY. Sit, sir.

 CAESAR. Nay, then. [They sit] ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,

 Or being, concern you not.

 CAESAR. I must be laugh'd at

 If, or for nothing or a little,

 Should say myself offended, and with you

 Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should

 Once name you derogately when to sound your name

 It not concern'd me.

 ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,

 What was't to you?

 CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome

 Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there

 Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt

 Might be my question.

 ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?

 CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent

 By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother

 Made wars upon me, and their contestation

 Was theme for you; you were the word of war.

 ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never

 Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,

 And have my learning from some true reports

 That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather

 Discredit my authority with yours,

 And make the wars alike against my stomach,

 Having alike your cause? Of this my letters

 Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,

 As matter whole you have not to make it with,

 It must not be with this.

 CAESAR. You praise yourself

 By laying defects of judgment to me; but

 You patch'd up your excuses.

 ANTONY. Not so, not so;

 I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,

 Very necessity of this thought, that I,

 Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,

 Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars

 Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,

 I would you had her spirit in such another!

 The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle

 You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

 ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!

 ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,

 Made out of her impatience- which not wanted

 Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant

 Did you too much disquiet. For that you must

 But say I could not help it.

 CAESAR. I wrote to you

 When rioting in Alexandria; you

 Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts

 Did gibe my missive out of audience.

 ANTONY. Sir,

 He fell upon me ere admitted. Then

 Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want

 Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day

 I told him of myself, which was as much

 As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow

 Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,

 Out of our question wipe him.

 CAESAR. You have broken

 The article of your oath, which you shall never

 Have tongue to charge me with.

 LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!

 ANTONY. No;

 Lepidus, let him speak.

 The honour is sacred which he talks on now,

 Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:

 The article of my oathCAESAR.

 To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,

 The which you both denied.

 ANTONY. Neglected, rather;

 And then when poisoned hours had bound me up

 From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,

 I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty

 Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power

 Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,

 To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;

 For which myself, the ignorant motive, do

 So far ask pardon as befits mine honour

 To stoop in such a case.

 LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.

 MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further

 The griefs between ye- to forget them quite

 Were to remember that the present need

 Speaks to atone you.

 LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.

 ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

 ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.

 ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot. ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more. ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!

 CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but

 The manner of his speech; for't cannot be

 We shall remain in friendship, our conditions

 So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew

 What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge

 O' th' world, I would pursue it.

 AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.

 CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.

 AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,

 Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony

 Is now a widower.

 CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.

 If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof

 Were well deserv'd of rashness.

 ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear

 Agrippa further speak.

 AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,

 To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts

 With an unslipping knot, take Antony

 Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims

 No worse a husband than the best of men;

 Whose virtue and whose general graces speak

 That which none else can utter. By this marriage

 All little jealousies, which now seem great,

 And all great fears, which now import their dangers,

 Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,

 Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both

 Would each to other, and all loves to both,

 Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;

 For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,

 By duty ruminated.

 ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?

 CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd

 With what is spoke already.

 ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,

 If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'

 To make this good?

 CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and

 His power unto Octavia.

 ANTONY. May I never

 To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,

 Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.

 Further this act of grace; and from this hour

 The heart of brothers govern in our loves

 And sway our great designs!

 CAESAR. There is my hand.

 A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother

 Did ever love so dearly. Let her live

 To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never

 Fly off our loves again!

 LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!

 ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;

 For he hath laid strange courtesies and great

 Of late upon me. I must thank him only,

 Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;

 At heel of that, defy him.

 LEPIDUS. Time calls upon's.

 Of us must Pompey presently be sought,

 Or else he seeks out us.

 ANTONY. Where lies he?

 CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.

 ANTONY. What is his strength by land?

 CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea

 He is an absolute master.

 ANTONY. So is the fame.

 Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.

 Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we

 The business we have talk'd of.

 CAESAR. With most gladness;

 And do invite you to my sister's view,

 Whither straight I'll lead you.

 ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,

 Not lack your company.

 LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,

 

      Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]

                       Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS

  

 

 MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.

 ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable friend, Agrippa!

 AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!

 MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.

 ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking.

 MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there. Is this true?

 ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting. MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her. ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.

 AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for her.

 ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.

 The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,

 Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;

 Purple the sails, and so perfumed that

 The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made

 The water which they beat to follow faster,

 As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,

 It beggar'd all description. She did lie

 In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,

 O'erpicturing that Venus where we see

 The fancy out-work nature. On each side her

 Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,

 With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem

 To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,

 And what they undid did.

 AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!

 ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,

 So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,

 And made their bends adornings. At the helm

 A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle

 Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands

 That yarely frame the office. From the barge

 A strange invisible perfume hits the sense

 Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast

 Her people out upon her; and Antony,

 Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,

 Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,

 Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,

 And made a gap in nature.

 AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!

 ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,

 Invited her to supper. She replied

 It should be better he became her guest;

 Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,

 Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,

 Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,

 And for his ordinary pays his heart

 For what his eyes eat only.

 AGRIPPA. Royal wench!

 She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.

 He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.

 ENOBARBUS. I saw her once

 Hop forty paces through the public street;

 And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,

 That she did make defect perfection,

 And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.

 MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.

 ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.

 Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale

 Her infinite variety. Other women cloy

 The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry

 Where most she satisfies; for vilest things

 Become themselves in her, that the holy priests

 Bless her when she is riggish.

 MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle

 The heart of Antony, Octavia is

 A blessed lottery to him.

 AGRIPPA. Let us go.

 Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest

 Whilst you abide here.

 ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Rome. CAESAR'S house

 Enter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them

 ANTONY. The world and my great office will sometimes

 Divide me from your bosom.

 OCTAVIA. All which time

 Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers

 To them for you.

 ANTONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,

 Read not my blemishes in the world's report.

 I have not kept my square; but that to come

 Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear lady.

 OCTAVIA. Good night, sir.

 CAESAR. Good night. Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA

 Enter SOOTHSAYER

 ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?

 SOOTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither! ANTONY. If you can- your reason.

 SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but yet hie you to Egypt again.

 ANTONY. Say to me,

 Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?

 SOOTHSAYER. Caesar's.

 Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.

 Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is

 Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,

 Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel

 Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore

 Make space enough between you.

 ANTONY. Speak this no more.

 SOOTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.

 If thou dost play with him at any game,

 Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck

 He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens

 When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit

 Is all afraid to govern thee near him;

 But, he away, 'tis noble.

 ANTONY. Get thee gone.

 Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.

 Exit SOOTHSAYER He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,

 He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;

 And in our sports my better cunning faints

 Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;

 His cocks do win the battle still of mine,

 When it is all to nought, and his quails ever

 Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;

 And though I make this marriage for my peace,

 I' th' East my pleasure lies.

 Enter VENTIDIUS

 O, come, Ventidius,

 You must to Parthia. Your commission's ready;

 Follow me and receive't. Exeunt

 SCENE IV.

 Rome. A street

 Enter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA

 LEPIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten

 Your generals after.

 AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony

 Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

 LEPIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,

 Which will become you both, farewell.

 MAECENAS. We shall,

 As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount

 Before you, Lepidus.

 LEPIDUS. Your way is shorter;

 My purposes do draw me much about.

 You'll win two days upon me.

 BOTH. Sir, good success!

 LEPIDUS. Farewell. Exeunt

 SCENE V.

 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

 CLEOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food

 Of us that trade in love.

 ALL. The music, ho!

 Enter MARDIAN the eunuch

 CLEOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian. CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

 CLEOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd

 As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?

 MARDIAN. As well as I can, madam.

 CLEOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short, The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.

 Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,

 My music playing far off, I will betray

 Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce

 Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up

 I'll think them every one an Antony,

 And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'

 CHARMIAN. 'Twas merry when

 You wager'd on your angling; when your diver

 Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he

 With fervency drew up.

 CLEOPATRA. That time? O times

 I laughed him out of patience; and that night

 I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,

 Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,

 Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst

 I wore his sword Philippan.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 O! from Italy?

 Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,

 That long time have been barren.

 MESSENGER. Madam, madamCLEOPATRA.

 Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,

 Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,

 If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here

 My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings

 Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

 MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.

 CLEOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.

 But, sirrah, mark, we use

 To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,

 The gold I give thee will I melt and pour

 Down thy ill-uttering throat.

 MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.

 CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.

 But there's no goodness in thy face. If Antony

 Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour

 To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,

 Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,

 Not like a formal man.

 MESSENGER. Will't please you hear me?

 CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st. Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,

 Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,

 I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail

 Rich pearls upon thee.

 MESSENGER. Madam, he's well.

 CLEOPATRA. Well said.

 MESSENGER. And friends with Caesar.

 CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.

 MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

 CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.

 MESSENGER. But yet, madamCLEOPATRA.

 I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay

 The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!

 'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth

 Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,

 Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,

 The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar;

 In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free. MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.

 He's bound unto Octavia.

 CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?

 MESSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.

 CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.

 MESSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.

 CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

 [Strikes him down] MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.

 CLEOPATRA. What say you? Hence, [Strikes him] Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes

 Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;

 [She hales him up and down] Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,

 Smarting in ling'ring pickle.

 MESSENGER. Gracious madam,

 I that do bring the news made not the match.

 CLEOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,

 And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst

 Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;

 And I will boot thee with what gift beside

 Thy modesty can beg.

 MESSENGER. He's married, madam.

 CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long. [Draws a knife] MESSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.

 What mean you, madam? I have made no fault. Exit CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:

 The man is innocent.

 CLEOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.

 Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures

 Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.

 Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!

 CHARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.

 CLEOPATRA. I will not hurt him.

 These hands do lack nobility, that they strike

 A meaner than myself; since I myself

 Have given myself the cause.

 Enter the MESSENGER again

 Come hither, sir.

 Though it be honest, it is never good

 To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message

 An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell

 Themselves when they be felt.

 MESSENGER. I have done my duty.

 CLEOPATRA. Is he married?

 I cannot hate thee worser than I do

 If thou again say 'Yes.'

 MESSENGER. He's married, madam.

 CLEOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still? MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?

 CLEOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,

 So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made

 A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.

 Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me

 Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

 MESSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.

 CLEOPATRA. He is married?

 MESSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;

 To punish me for what you make me do

 Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.

 CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee

 That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.

 The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome

 Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,

 And be undone by 'em! Exit MESSENGER CHARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.

 CLEOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.

 CHARMIAN. Many times, madam.

 CLEOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,

 I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.

 Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him

 Report the feature of Octavia, her years,

 Her inclination; let him not leave out

 The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.

 Exit ALEXAS Let him for ever go- let him not, CharmianThough

 he be painted one way like a Gorgon,

 The other way's a Mars. [To MARDIAN] Bid you Alexas

 Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,

 But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber. Exeunt

 SCENE VI.

 Near Misenum

 Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet; at another, CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, AGRIPPA, with soldiers marching

 POMPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;

 And we shall talk before we fight.

 CAESAR. Most meet

 That first we come to words; and therefore have we

 Our written purposes before us sent;

 Which if thou hast considered, let us know

 If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword

 And carry back to Sicily much tall youth

 That else must perish here.

 POMPEY. To you all three,

 The senators alone of this great world,

 Chief factors for the gods: I do not know

 Wherefore my father should revengers want,

 Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,

 Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,

 There saw you labouring for him. What was't

 That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what

 Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus,

 With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,

 To drench the Capitol, but that they would

 Have one man but a man? And that is it

 Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden

 The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant

 To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome

 Cast on my noble father.

 CAESAR. Take your time.

 ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;

 We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st

 How much we do o'er-count thee.

 POMPEY. At land, indeed,

 Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house.

 But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,

 Remain in't as thou mayst.

 LEPIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell usFor

 this is from the present- how you take

 The offers we have sent you.

 CAESAR. There's the point.

 ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh

 What it is worth embrac'd.

 CAESAR. And what may follow,

 To try a larger fortune.

 POMPEY. You have made me offer

 Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must

 Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send

 Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,

 To part with unhack'd edges and bear back

 Our targes undinted.

 ALL. That's our offer.

 POMPEY. Know, then,

 I came before you here a man prepar'd

 To take this offer; but Mark Antony

 Put me to some impatience. Though I lose

 The praise of it by telling, you must know,

 When Caesar and your brother were at blows,

 Your mother came to Sicily and did find

 Her welcome friendly.

 ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,

 And am well studied for a liberal thanks

 Which I do owe you.

 POMPEY. Let me have your hand.

 I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

 ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you, That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;

 For I have gained by't.

 CAESAR. Since I saw you last

 There is a change upon you.

 POMPEY. Well, I know not

 What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;

 But in my bosom shall she never come

 To make my heart her vassal.

 LEPIDUS. Well met here.

 POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.

 I crave our composition may be written,

 And seal'd between us.

 CAESAR. That's the next to do.

 POMPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's

 Draw lots who shall begin.

 ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.

 POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;

 But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery

 Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar

 Grew fat with feasting there.

 ANTONY. You have heard much.

 POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.

 ANTONY. And fair words to them.

 POMPEY. Then so much have I heard;

 And I have heard Apollodorus carriedENOBARBUS.

 No more of that! He did so.

 POMPEY. What, I pray you?

 ENOBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

 POMPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?

 ENOBARBUS. Well;

 And well am like to do, for I perceive

 Four feasts are toward.

 POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand.

 I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,

 When I have envied thy behaviour.

 ENOBARBUS. Sir,

 I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye

 When you have well deserv'd ten times as much

 As I have said you did.

 POMPEY. Enjoy thy plainness;

 It nothing ill becomes thee.

 Aboard my galley I invite you all.

 Will you lead, lords?

 ALL. Show's the way, sir.

 POMPEY. Come. Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this treaty.- You and I have known, sir.

 ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think.

 MENAS. We have, sir.

 ENOBARBUS. You have done well by water.

 MENAS. And you by land.

 ENOBARBUS. I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.

 MENAS. Nor what I have done by water.

 ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.

 MENAS. And you by land.

 ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.

 MENAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are. ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face. MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts.

 ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.

 MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

 ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.

 MENAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

 ENOBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.

 MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

 ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

 MENAS. Pray ye, sir?

 ENOBARBUS. 'Tis true.

 MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

 ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.

 MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.

 ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation. MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?

 ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.

 MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.

 ENOBARBUS. I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt. MENAS. Come, let's away. Exeunt

 ACT_2|SC_7

 

                             SCENE VII.

               On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum

  

 

 Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet

 FIRST SERVANT. Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them down.

 SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-colour'd.

 FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink.

 SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th' drink.

 FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.

 SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partizan I could not heave.

 FIRST SERVANT. To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

 A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,

 

              POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,

                           with other CAPTAINS

  

 

 ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'

 Nile

 By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know

 By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth

 Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells

 The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman

 Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,

 And shortly comes to harvest.

 LEPIDUS. Y'have strange serpents there.

 ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.

 LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.

 ANTONY. They are so.

 POMPEY. Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

 LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out. ENOBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till then.

 LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that. MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.

 POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?

 MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,

 Captain,

 And hear me speak a word.

 POMPEY. [ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anonThis

 wine for Lepidus!

 LEPIDUS. What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

 ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.

 LEPIDUS. What colour is it of?

 ANTONY. Of it own colour too.

 LEPIDUS. 'Tis a strange serpent.

 ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

 CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?

 ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure.

 POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!

 Away!

 Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?

 MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear

 me,

 Rise from thy stool.

 POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks aside] The matter?

 MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

 POMPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?- Be jolly, lords.

 ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,

 Keep off them, for you sink.

 MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

 POMPEY. What say'st thou?

 MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice. POMPEY. How should that be?

 MENAS. But entertain it,

 And though you think me poor, I am the man

 Will give thee all the world.

 POMPEY. Hast thou drunk well?

 MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.

 Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;

 Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips

 Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

 POMPEY. Show me which way.

 MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors,

 Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;

 And when we are put off, fall to their throats.

 All there is thine.

 POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done,

 And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:

 In thee't had been good service. Thou must know

 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:

 Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue

 Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown,

 I should have found it afterwards well done,

 But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

 MENAS. [Aside] For this,

 I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.

 Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,

 Shall never find it more.

 POMPEY. This health to Lepidus!

 ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

 ENOBARBUS. Here's to thee, Menas!

 MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!

 POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.

 ENOBARBUS. There's a strong fellow, Menas.

 [Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS] MENAS. Why?

 ENOBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not? MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all, That it might go on wheels!

 ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.

 MENAS. Come.

 POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

 ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!

 Here's to Caesar!

 CAESAR. I could well forbear't.

 It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain

 And it grows fouler.

 ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time.

 CAESAR. Possess it, I'll make answer.

 But I had rather fast from all four days

 Than drink so much in one.

 ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!

 Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals

 And celebrate our drink?

 POMPEY. Let's ha't, good soldier.

 ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands,

 Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense

 In soft and delicate Lethe.

 ENOBARBUS. All take hands.

 Make battery to our ears with the loud music,

 The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing;

 The holding every man shall bear as loud

 As his strong sides can volley.

 [Music plays. ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand]

 

                          THE SONG

              Come, thou monarch of the vine,

              Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!

              In thy fats our cares be drown'd,

              With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd.

              Cup us till the world go round,

              Cup us till the world go round!

  

 

 CAESAR. What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother, Let me request you off; our graver business

 Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;

 You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb

 Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue

 Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost

 Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.

 Good Antony, your hand.

 POMPEY. I'll try you on the shore.

 ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.

 POMPEY. O Antony,

 You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.

 Come, down into the boat.

 ENOBARBUS. Take heed you fall not.

 Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS Menas, I'll not on shore.

 MENAS. No, to my cabin.

 These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!

 Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell

 To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!

 [Sound a flourish, with drums] ENOBARBUS. Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.

 MENAS. Hoo! Noble Captain, come. Exeunt ACT_3|SC_1

 

                       ACT III. SCENE I.

                       A plain in Syria

  

 

 Enter VENTIDIUS, as it were in triumph, with SILIUS

 and other Romans, OFFICERS and soldiers; the dead body

 of PACORUS borne before him

 VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death

 Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body

 Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,

 Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

 SILIUS. Noble Ventidius,

 Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm

 The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,

 Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither

 The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,

 Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and

 Put garlands on thy head.

 VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius,

 I have done enough. A lower place, note well,

 May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:

 Better to leave undone than by our deed

 Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.

 Caesar and Antony have ever won

 More in their officer, than person. Sossius,

 One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,

 For quick accumulation of renown,

 Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour.

 Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can

 Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,

 The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss

 Than gain which darkens him.

 I could do more to do Antonius good,

 But 'twould offend him; and in his offence

 Should my performance perish.

 SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that

 Without the which a soldier and his sword

 Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?

 VENTIDIUS. I'll humbly signify what in his name,

 That magical word of war, we have effected;

 How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,

 The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia

 We have jaded out o' th' field.

 SILIUS. Where is he now?

 VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste The weight we must convey with's will permit,

 We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.

 SCENE II. Rome. CAESAR'S house

 Enter AGRIPPA at one door, ENOBARBUS at another

 AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?

 ENOBARBUS. They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;

 The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps

 To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,

 Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled

 With the green sickness.

 AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.

 ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!

 AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

 ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.

 AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

 ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!

 AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

 ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further. AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises. ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony. Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-

 His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,

 Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

 AGRIPPA. Both he loves.

 ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets

 within] SoThis

 is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

 AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.

 Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

 ANTONY. No further, sir.

 CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself;

 Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife

 As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band

 Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,

 Let not the piece of virtue which is set

 Betwixt us as the cement of our love

 To keep it builded be the ram to batter

 The fortress of it; for better might we

 Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts

 This be not cherish'd.

 ANTONY. Make me not offended

 In your distrust.

 CAESAR. I have said.

 ANTONY. You shall not find,

 Though you be therein curious, the least cause

 For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,

 And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!

 We will here part.

 CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.

 The elements be kind to thee and make

 Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.

 OCTAVIA. My noble brother!

 ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,

 And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

 OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband's house; andCAESAR.

 What, Octavia?

 OCTAVIA. I'll tell you in your ear.

 ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can

 Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather,

 That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,

 And neither way inclines.

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

 AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a

 horse;

 So is he, being a man.

 AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,

 When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,

 He cried almost to roaring; and he wept

 When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled

 with a rheum;

 What willingly he did confound he wail'd,

 Believe't- till I weep too.

 CAESAR. No, sweet Octavia,

 You shall hear from me still; the time shall not

 Out-go my thinking on you.

 ANTONY. Come, sir, come;

 I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.

 Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,

 And give you to the gods.

 CAESAR. Adieu; be happy!

 LEPIDUS. Let all the number of the stars give light

 To thy fair way!

 

    CAESAR. Farewell, farewell!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]

    ANTONY. Farewell!                       Trumpets sound. Exeunt

                Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

  

 

 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

 CLEOPATRA. Where is the fellow?

 ALEXAS. Half afeard to come.

 CLEOPATRA. Go to, go to.

 Enter the MESSENGER as before

 Come hither, sir.

 ALEXAS. Good Majesty,

 Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you

 But when you are well pleas'd.

 CLEOPATRA. That Herod's head

 I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,

 Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

 MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!

 CLEOPATRA. Didst thou behold Octavia?

 MESSENGER. Ay, dread Queen.

 CLEOPATRA. Where?

 MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome

 I look'd her in the face, and saw her led

 Between her brother and Mark Antony.

 CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?

 MESSENGER. She is not, madam.

 CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low? MESSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.

 CLEOPATRA. That's not so good. He cannot like her long.

 CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.

 CLEOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish! What majesty is in her gait? Remember,

 If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

 MESSENGER. She creeps.

 Her motion and her station are as one;

 She shows a body rather than a life,

 A statue than a breather.

 CLEOPATRA. Is this certain?

 MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.

 CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt

 Cannot make better note.

 CLEOPATRA. He's very knowing;

 I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.

 The fellow has good judgment.

 CHARMIAN. Excellent.

 CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.

 MESSENGER. Madam,

 She was a widow.

 CLEOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark!

 MESSENGER. And I do think she's thirty.

 CLEOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round? MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.

 CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. Her hair, what colour?

 MESSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead

 As low as she would wish it.

 CLEOPATRA. There's gold for thee.

 Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.

 I will employ thee back again; I find thee

 Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;

 Our letters are prepar'd. Exeunt MESSENGER CHARMIAN. A proper man.

 CLEOPATRA. Indeed, he is so. I repent me much

 That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,

 This creature's no such thing.

 CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam.

 CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know. CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,

 And serving you so long!

 CLEOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian. But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me

 Where I will write. All may be well enough.

 CHARMIAN. I warrant you, madam. Exeunt

                    Athens. ANTONY'S house

  

                   Enter ANTONY and OCTAVIA

  

 

 ANTONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only thatThat

 were excusable, that and thousands more

 Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd

 New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it

 To public ear;

 Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not

 But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly

 He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;

 When the best hint was given him, he not took't,

 Or did it from his teeth.

 OCTAVIA. O my good lord,

 Believe not all; or if you must believe,

 Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,

 If this division chance, ne'er stood between,

 Praying for both parts.

 The good gods will mock me presently

 When I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband!'

 Undo that prayer by crying out as loud

 'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,

 Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way

 'Twixt these extremes at all.

 ANTONY. Gentle Octavia,

 Let your best love draw to that point which seeks

 Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,

 I lose myself; better I were not yours

 Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,

 Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady,

 I'll raise the preparation of a war

 Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;

 So your desires are yours.

 OCTAVIA. Thanks to my lord.

 The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,

 Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be

 As if the world should cleave, and that slain men

 Should solder up the rift.

 ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins,

 Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults

 Can never be so equal that your love

 Can equally move with them. Provide your going;

 Choose your own company, and command what cost

 Your heart has mind to. Exeunt

                     Athens. ANTONY'S house

  

               Enter ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting

  

 

 ENOBARBUS. How now, friend Eros!

 EROS. There's strange news come, sir.

 ENOBARBUS. What, man?

 EROS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

 ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the success?

 EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him. So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine. ENOBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more; And throw between them all the food thou hast,

 They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

 EROS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns

 The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'

 And threats the throat of that his officer

 That murd'red Pompey.

 ENOBARBUS. Our great navy's rigg'd.

 EROS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:

 My lord desires you presently; my news

 I might have told hereafter.

 ENOBARBUS. 'Twill be naught;

 But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

 EROS. Come, sir. Exeunt

                            SCENE VI.

                     Rome. CAESAR'S house

  

               Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS

  

 

 CAESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more

 In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:

 I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,

 Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold

 Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat

 Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,

 And all the unlawful issue that their lust

 Since then hath made between them. Unto her

 He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her

 Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,

 Absolute queen.

 MAECENAS. This in the public eye?

 CAESAR. I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.

 His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:

 Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,

 He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd

 Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She

 In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis

 That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,

 As 'tis reported, so.

 MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus

 Inform'd.

 AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence

 Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

 CAESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv'd

 His accusations.

 AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?

 CAESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily

 Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him

 His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me

 Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets

 That Lepidus of the triumvirate

 Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain

 All his revenue.

 AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.

 CAESAR. 'Tis done already, and messenger gone.

 I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,

 That he his high authority abus'd,

 And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd

 I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia

 And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,

 Demand the like.

 MAECENAS. He'll never yield to that.

 CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

 Enter OCTAVIA, with her train

 OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar! CAESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!

 OCTAVIA. You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

 CAESAR. Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not

 Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony

 Should have an army for an usher, and

 The neighs of horse to tell of her approach

 Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way

 Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,

 Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust

 Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,

 Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come

 A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented

 The ostentation of our love, which left unshown

 Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you

 By sea and land, supplying every stage

 With an augmented greeting.

 OCTAVIA. Good my lord,

 To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it

 On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,

 Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted

 My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd

 His pardon for return.

 CAESAR. Which soon he granted,

 Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.

 OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.

 CAESAR. I have eyes upon him,

 And his affairs come to me on the wind.

 Where is he now?

 OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens.

 CAESAR. No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra

 Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire

 Up to a whore, who now are levying

 The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled

 Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus

 Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king

 Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;

 King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;

 Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king

 Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,

 The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with

 More larger list of sceptres.

 OCTAVIA. Ay me most wretched,

 That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,

 That does afflict each other!

 CAESAR. Welcome hither.

 Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,

 Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led

 And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;

 Be you not troubled with the time, which drives

 O'er your content these strong necessities,

 But let determin'd things to destiny

 Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;

 Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd

 Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,

 To do you justice, make their ministers

 Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,

 And ever welcome to us.

 AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.

 MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.

 Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;

 Only th' adulterous Antony, most large

 In his abominations, turns you off,

 And gives his potent regiment to a trull

 That noises it against us.

 OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?

 CAESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you

 Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister! Exeunt

                    ANTONY'S camp near Actium

  

                  Enter CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS

  

 

 CLEOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

 ENOBARBUS. But why, why,

 CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,

 And say'st it is not fit.

 ENOBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?

 CLEOPATRA. Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we Be there in person?

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:

 If we should serve with horse and mares together

 The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear

 A soldier and his horse.

 CLEOPATRA. What is't you say?

 ENOBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;

 Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,

 What should not then be spar'd. He is already

 Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome

 That Photinus an eunuch and your maids

 Manage this war.

 CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot

 That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,

 And, as the president of my kingdom, will

 Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;

 I will not stay behind.

 Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS

 ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done.

 Here comes the Emperor.

 ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,

 That from Tarentum and Brundusium

 He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,

 And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?

 CLEOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir'd

 Than by the negligent.

 ANTONY. A good rebuke,

 Which might have well becom'd the best of men

 To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we

 Will fight with him by sea.

 CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else?

 CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?

 ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.

 ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.

 CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,

 Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,

 Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;

 And so should you.

 ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;

 Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people

 Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet

 Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;

 Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace

 Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,

 Being prepar'd for land.

 ANTONY. By sea, by sea.

 ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away

 The absolute soldiership you have by land;

 Distract your army, which doth most consist

 Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted

 Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo

 The way which promises assurance; and

 Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard

 From firm security.

 ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.

 CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

 ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,

 And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,

 We then can do't at land.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 Thy business?

 MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;

 Caesar has taken Toryne.

 ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossibleStrange

 that his power should be. Canidius,

 Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,

 And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.

 Away, my Thetis!

 Enter a SOLDIER

 How now, worthy soldier?

 SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;

 Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt

 This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians

 And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we

 Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth

 And fighting foot to foot.

 ANTONY. Well, well- away.

 Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.

 CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows

 Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,

 And we are women's men.

 SOLDIER. You keep by land

 The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

 CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,

 Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;

 But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's

 Carries beyond belief.

 SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome,

 His power went out in such distractions as

 Beguil'd all spies.

 CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

 SOLDIER. They say one Taurus.

 CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.

 CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way

 over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of

 CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard

 the noise of a sea-fight

 Alarum. Enter ENOBARBUS

 ENOBARBUS. Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer. Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,

 With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.

 To see't mine eyes are blasted.

 Enter SCARUS

 SCARUS. Gods and goddesses,

 All the whole synod of them!

 ENOBARBUS. What's thy passion?

 SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost

 With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away

 Kingdoms and provinces.

 ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight?

 SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence,

 Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of EgyptWhom

 leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,

 When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,

 Both as the same, or rather ours the elderThe

 breese upon her, like a cow in JuneHoists

 sails and flies.

 ENOBARBUS. That I beheld;

 Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not

 Endure a further view.

 SCARUS. She once being loof'd,

 The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,

 Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,

 Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.

 I never saw an action of such shame;

 Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before

 Did violate so itself.

 ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack!

 Enter CANIDIUS

 CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,

 And sinks most lamentably. Had our general

 Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.

 O, he has given example for our flight

 Most grossly by his own!

 ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts?

 Why then, good night indeed.

 CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

 SCARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend

 What further comes.

 CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render

 My legions and my horse; six kings already

 Show me the way of yielding.

 ENOBARBUS. I'll yet follow

 The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason

 Sits in the wind against me. Exeunt

                 Enter ANTONY With attendants

  

 

 ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;

 It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.

 I am so lated in the world that I

 Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship

 Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,

 And make your peace with Caesar.

 ALL. Fly? Not we!

 ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards

 To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;

 I have myself resolv'd upon a course

 Which has no need of you; be gone.

 My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,

 I follow'd that I blush to look upon.

 My very hairs do mutiny; for the white

 Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them

 For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall

 Have letters from me to some friends that will

 Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,

 Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint

 Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left

 Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.

 I will possess you of that ship and treasure.

 Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;

 Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;

 Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by. [Sits down]

 

              Enter CLEOPATRA, led by CHARMIAN and IRAS,

                           EROS following

  

 

 EROS. Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.

 IRAS. Do, most dear Queen.

 CHARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?

 CLEOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!

 ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.

 EROS. See you here, sir?

 ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!

 CHARMIAN. Madam!

 IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!

 EROS. Sir, sir!

 ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept

 His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck

 The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I

 That the mad Brutus ended; he alone

 Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had

 In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter.

 CLEOPATRA. Ah, stand by!

 EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen!

 IRAS. Go to him, madam, speak to him.

 He is unqualitied with very shame.

 CLEOPATRA. Well then, sustain me. O!

 EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approaches.

 Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but

 Your comfort makes the rescue.

 ANTONY. I have offended reputationA

 most unnoble swerving.

 EROS. Sir, the Queen.

 ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See

 How I convey my shame out of thine eyes

 By looking back what I have left behind

 'Stroy'd in dishonour.

 CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord,

 Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought

 You would have followed.

 ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well

 My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings,

 And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit

 Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that

 Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods

 Command me.

 CLEOPATRA. O, my pardon!

 ANTONY. Now I must

 To the young man send humble treaties, dodge

 And palter in the shifts of lowness, who

 With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,

 Making and marring fortunes. You did know

 How much you were my conqueror, and that

 My sword, made weak by my affection, would

 Obey it on all cause.

 CLEOPATRA. Pardon, pardon!

 ANTONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates

 All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;

 Even this repays me.

 We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?

 Love, I am full of lead. Some wine,

 Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows

 We scorn her most when most she offers blows. Exeunt

                           SCENE XII.

                     CAESAR'S camp in Egypt

  

 

 Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others

 CAESAR. Let him appear that's come from Antony.

 Know you him?

 DOLABELLA. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:

 An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither

 He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,

 Which had superfluous kings for messengers

 Not many moons gone by.

 Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY

 CAESAR. Approach, and speak.

 EUPHRONIUS. Such as I am, I come from Antony.

 I was of late as petty to his ends

 As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf

 To his grand sea.

 CAESAR. Be't so. Declare thine office.

 EUPHRONIUS. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and

 Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,

 He lessens his requests and to thee sues

 To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,

 A private man in Athens. This for him.

 Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,

 Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves

 The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,

 Now hazarded to thy grace.

 CAESAR. For Antony,

 I have no ears to his request. The Queen

 Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she

 From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,

 Or take his life there. This if she perform,

 She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

 EUPHRONIUS. Fortune pursue thee!

 CAESAR. Bring him through the bands. Exit EUPHRONIUS [To THYREUS] To try thy eloquence, now 'tis time. Dispatch; From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,

 And in our name, what she requires; add more,

 From thine invention, offers. Women are not

 In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure

 The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cunning, Thyreus;

 Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we

 Will answer as a law.

 THYREUS. Caesar, I go.

 CAESAR. Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,

 And what thou think'st his very action speaks

 In every power that moves.

 THYREUS. Caesar, I shall. Exeunt

                             SCENE XIII.

                 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

  

 

 Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS

 CLEOPATRA. What shall we do, Enobarbus?

 ENOBARBUS. Think, and die.

 CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?

 ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will

 Lord of his reason. What though you fled

 From that great face of war, whose several ranges

 Frighted each other? Why should he follow?

 The itch of his affection should not then

 Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,

 When half to half the world oppos'd, he being

 The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less

 Than was his loss, to course your flying flags

 And leave his navy gazing.

 CLEOPATRA. Prithee, peace.

 Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY

 ANTONY. Is that his answer?

 EUPHRONIUS. Ay, my lord.

 ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she

 Will yield us up.

 EUPHRONIUS. He says so.

 ANTONY. Let her know't.

 To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,

 And he will fill thy wishes to the brim

 With principalities.

 CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?

 ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose

 Of youth upon him; from which the world should note

 Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,

 May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail

 Under the service of a child as soon

 As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore

 To lay his gay comparisons apart,

 And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,

 Ourselves alone. I'll write it. Follow me.

 Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS EUPHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show

 Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are

 A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward

 Do draw the inward quality after them,

 To suffer all alike. That he should dream,

 Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will

 Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd

 His judgment too.

 Enter a SERVANT

 SERVANT. A messenger from Caesar.

 CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women!

 Against the blown rose may they stop their nose

 That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir. Exit SERVANT ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.

 The loyalty well held to fools does make

 Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure

 To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord

 Does conquer him that did his master conquer,

 And earns a place i' th' story.

 Enter THYREUS

 CLEOPATRA. Caesar's will?

 THYREUS. Hear it apart.

 CLEOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.

 THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.

 ENOBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,

 Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master

 Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know

 Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.

 THYREUS. So.

 Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats

 Not to consider in what case thou stand'st

 Further than he is Caesar.

 CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royal!

 THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony

 As you did love, but as you fear'd him.

 CLEOPATRA. O!

 THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he

 Does pity, as constrained blemishes,

 Not as deserv'd.

 CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows

 What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,

 But conquer'd merely.

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that,

 I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky

 That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for

 Thy dearest quit thee. Exit THYREUS. Shall I say to Caesar

 What you require of him? For he partly begs

 To be desir'd to give. It much would please him

 That of his fortunes you should make a staff

 To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits

 To hear from me you had left Antony,

 And put yourself under his shroud,

 The universal landlord.

 CLEOPATRA. What's your name?

 THYREUS. My name is Thyreus.

 CLEOPATRA. Most kind messenger,

 Say to great Caesar this: in deputation

 I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt

 To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.

 Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear

 The doom of Egypt.

 THYREUS. 'Tis your noblest course.

 Wisdom and fortune combating together,

 If that the former dare but what it can,

 No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay

 My duty on your hand.

 CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft,

 When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,

 Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,

 As it rain'd kisses.

 Re-enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS

 ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders!

 What art thou, fellow?

 THYREUS. One that but performs

 The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest

 To have command obey'd.

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside] You will be whipt.

 ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils! Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'

 Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth

 And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am

 Antony yet.

 Enter servants

 Take hence this Jack and whip him.

 ENOBARBUS. 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp

 Than with an old one dying.

 ANTONY. Moon and stars!

 Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries

 That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them

 So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name

 Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,

 Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,

 And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.

 THYMUS. Mark AntonyANTONY.

 Tug him away. Being whipt,

 Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall

 Bear us an errand to him. Exeunt servants with THYREUS You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!

 Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,

 Forborne the getting of a lawful race,

 And by a gem of women, to be abus'd

 By one that looks on feeders?

 CLEOPATRA. Good my lordANTONY.

 You have been a boggler ever.

 But when we in our viciousness grow hardO

 misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,

 In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us

 Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut

 To our confusion.

 CLEOPATRA. O, is't come to this?

 ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon

 Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment

 Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,

 Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have

 Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,

 Though you can guess what temperance should be,

 You know not what it is.

 CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this?

 ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,

 And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with

 My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal

 And plighter of high hearts! O that I were

 Upon the hill of Basan to outroar

 The horned herd! For I have savage cause,

 And to proclaim it civilly were like

 A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank

 For being yare about him.

 Re-enter a SERVANT with THYREUS

 Is he whipt?

 SERVANT. Soundly, my lord.

 ANTONY. Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?

 SERVANT. He did ask favour.

 ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent

 Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry

 To follow Caesar in his triumph, since

 Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth

 The white hand of a lady fever thee!

 Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;

 Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say

 He makes me angry with him; for he seems

 Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,

 Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;

 And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,

 When my good stars, that were my former guides,

 Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires

 Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike

 My speech and what is done, tell him he has

 Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom

 He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,

 As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.

 Hence with thy stripes, be gone. Exit THYREUS CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet?

 ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon

 Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone

 The fall of Antony.

 CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time.

 ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes

 With one that ties his points?

 CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet?

 ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?

 CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so,

 From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,

 And poison it in the source, and the first stone

 Drop in my neck; as it determines, so

 Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!

 Till by degrees the memory of my womb,

 Together with my brave Egyptians all,

 By the discandying of this pelleted storm,

 Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile

 Have buried them for prey.

 ANTONY. I am satisfied.

 Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where

 I will oppose his fate. Our force by land

 Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to

 Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.

 Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?

 If from the field I shall return once more

 To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.

 I and my sword will earn our chronicle.

 There's hope in't yet.

 CLEOPATRA. That's my brave lord!

 ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,

 And fight maliciously. For when mine hours

 Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives

 Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,

 And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,

 Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me

 All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;

 Let's mock the midnight bell.

 CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday.

 I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord

 Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

 ANTONY. We will yet do well.

 CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble captains to my lord.

 ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,

 There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight

 I'll make death love me; for I will contend

 Even with his pestilent scythe. Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood

 The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still

 A diminution in our captain's brain

 Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,

 It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek

 Some way to leave him. Exit

 Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS, with his army;

 CAESAR reading a letter

 CAESAR. He calls me boy, and chides as he had power

 To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger

 He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,

 Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know

 I have many other ways to die, meantime

 Laugh at his challenge.

 MAECENAS. Caesar must think

 When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted

 Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now

 Make boot of his distraction. Never anger

 Made good guard for itself.

 CAESAR. Let our best heads

 Know that to-morrow the last of many battles

 We mean to fight. Within our files there are

 Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late

 Enough to fetch him in. See it done;

 And feast the army; we have store to do't,

 And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony! Exeunt

 Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS,

 ALEXAS, with others

 ANTONY. He will not fight with me, Domitius?

 ENOBARBUS. No.

 ANTONY. Why should he not?

 ENOBARBUS. He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune, He is twenty men to one.

 ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,

 By sea and land I'll fight. Or I will live,

 Or bathe my dying honour in the blood

 Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?

 ENOBARBUS. I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

 ANTONY. Well said; come on.

 Call forth my household servants; let's to-night

 Be bounteous at our meal.

 Enter three or four servitors

 Give me thy hand,

 Thou has been rightly honest. So hast thou;

 Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me well,

 And kings have been your fellows.

 CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd tricks which

 sorrow shoots

 Out of the mind.

 ANTONY. And thou art honest too.

 I wish I could be made so many men,

 And all of you clapp'd up together in

 An Antony, that I might do you service

 So good as you have done.

 SERVANT. The gods forbid!

 ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.

 Scant not my cups, and make as much of me

 As when mine empire was your fellow too,

 And suffer'd my command.

 CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?

 ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep. ANTONY. Tend me to-night;

 May be it is the period of your duty.

 Haply you shall not see me more; or if,

 A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow

 You'll serve another master. I look on you

 As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,

 I turn you not away; but, like a master

 Married to your good service, stay till death.

 Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,

 And the gods yield you for't!

 ENOBARBUS. What mean you, sir,

 To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;

 And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For shame!

 Transform us not to women.

 ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho!

 Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!

 Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,

 You take me in too dolorous a sense;

 For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you

 To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,

 I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you

 Where rather I'll expect victorious life

 Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,

 And drown consideration. Exeunt

 FIRST SOLDIER. Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day. SECOND SOLDIER. It will determine one way. Fare you well. Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?

 FIRST SOLDIER. Nothing. What news?

 SECOND SOLDIER. Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you. FIRST SOLDIER. Well, sir, good night.

 [They meet other soldiers] SECOND SOLDIER. Soldiers, have careful watch.

 FIRST SOLDIER. And you. Good night, good night.

 

                  [The two companies separate and place themselves

                                     in every corner of the stage]

  

 

 SECOND SOLDIER. Here we. And if to-morrow

 Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope

 Our landmen will stand up.

 THIRD SOLDIER. 'Tis a brave army,

 And full of purpose.

 [Music of the hautboys is under the stage] SECOND SOLDIER. Peace, what noise?

 THIRD SOLDIER. List, list!

 SECOND SOLDIER. Hark!

 THIRD SOLDIER. Music i' th' air.

 FOURTH SOLDIER. Under the earth.

 THIRD SOLDIER. It signs well, does it not?

 FOURTH SOLDIER. No.

 THIRD SOLDIER. Peace, I say!

 What should this mean?

 SECOND SOLDIER. 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd, Now leaves him.

 THIRD SOLDIER. Walk; let's see if other watchmen

 Do hear what we do.

 SECOND SOLDIER. How now, masters!

 SOLDIERS. [Speaking together] How now!

 How now! Do you hear this?

 FIRST SOLDIER. Ay; is't not strange?

 THIRD SOLDIER. Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?

 FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter; Let's see how it will give off.

 SOLDIERS. Content. 'Tis strange. Exeunt

 with others

 ANTONY. Eros! mine armour, Eros!

 CLEOPATRA. Sleep a little.

 ANTONY. No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!

 Enter EROS with armour

 Come, good fellow, put mine iron on.

 If fortune be not ours to-day, it is

 Because we brave her. Come.

 CLEOPATRA. Nay, I'll help too.

 What's this for?

 ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art

 The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this.

 CLEOPATRA. Sooth, la, I'll help. Thus it must be.

 ANTONY. Well, well;

 We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?

 Go put on thy defences.

 EROS. Briefly, sir.

 CLEOPATRA. Is not this buckled well?

 ANTONY. Rarely, rarely!

 He that unbuckles this, till we do please

 To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.

 Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire

 More tight at this than thou. Dispatch. O love,

 That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st

 The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see

 A workman in't.

 Enter an armed SOLDIER

 Good-morrow to thee. Welcome.

 Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.

 To business that we love we rise betime,

 And go to't with delight.

 SOLDIER. A thousand, sir,

 Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,

 And at the port expect you.

 [Shout. Flourish of trumpets within]

 Enter CAPTAINS and soldiers

 CAPTAIN. The morn is fair. Good morrow, General.

 ALL. Good morrow, General.

 ANTONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.

 This morning, like the spirit of a youth

 That means to be of note, begins betimes.

 So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.

 Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.

 This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,

 And worthy shameful check it were, to stand

 On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee

 Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,

 Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

 Exeunt ANTONY, EROS, CAPTAINS and soldiers CHARMIAN. Please you retire to your chamber?

 CLEOPATRA. Lead me.

 He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might

 Determine this great war in single fight!

 Then, Antony- but now. Well, on. Exeunt

 Trumpets sound. Enter ANTONY and EROS, a SOLDIER

 meeting them

 SOLDIER. The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

 ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd To make me fight at land!

 SOLDIER. Hadst thou done so,

 The kings that have revolted, and the soldier

 That has this morning left thee, would have still

 Followed thy heels.

 ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?

 SOLDIER. Who?

 One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,

 He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp

 Say 'I am none of thine.'

 ANTONY. What say'st thou?

 SOLDIER. Sir,

 He is with Caesar.

 EROS. Sir, his chests and treasure

 He has not with him.

 ANTONY. Is he gone?

 SOLDIER. Most certain.

 ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;

 Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to himI

 will subscribe- gentle adieus and greetings;

 Say that I wish he never find more cause

 To change a master. O, my fortunes have

 Corrupted honest men! Dispatch. Enobarbus! Exeunt

 Our will is Antony be took alive;

 AGRIPPA. Caesar, I shall. Exit CAESAR. The time of universal peace is near.

 Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world

 Shall bear the olive freely.

 Enter A MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. Antony

 Is come into the field.

 CAESAR. Go charge Agrippa

 Plant those that have revolted in the vant,

 That Antony may seem to spend his fury

 Upon himself. Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS ENOBARBUS. Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on

 Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade

 Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar

 And leave his master Antony. For this pains

 Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest

 That fell away have entertainment, but

 No honourable trust. I have done ill,

 Of which I do accuse myself so sorely

 That I will joy no more.

 Enter a SOLDIER of CAESAR'S

 SOLDIER. Enobarbus, Antony

 Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with

 His bounty overplus. The messenger

 Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now

 Unloading of his mules.

 ENOBARBUS. I give it you.

 SOLDIER. Mock not, Enobarbus.

 I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer

 Out of the host. I must attend mine office,

 Or would have done't myself. Your emperor

 Continues still a Jove. Exit ENOBARBUS. I am alone the villain of the earth,

 And feel I am so most. O Antony,

 Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid

 My better service, when my turpitude

 Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.

 If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean

 Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel. I fight against thee? No! I will go seek

 Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits

 My latter part of life. Exit

 Caesar himself has work, and our oppression

 Exceeds what we expected. Exeunt

 Alarums. Enter ANTONY, and SCARUS wounded

 SCARUS. O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!

 Had we done so at first, we had droven them home

 With clouts about their heads.

 ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.

 SCARUS. I had a wound here that was like a T,

 But now 'tis made an H.

 ANTONY. They do retire.

 SCARUS. We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet

 Room for six scotches more.

 Enter EROS

 EROS. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves

 For a fair victory.

 SCARUS. Let us score their backs

 And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.

 'Tis sport to maul a runner.

 ANTONY. I will reward thee

 Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold

 For thy good valour. Come thee on.

 with others

 ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before

 And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,

 Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood

 That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;

 For doughty-handed are you, and have fought

 Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been

 Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.

 Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,

 Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears

 Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss

 The honour'd gashes whole.

 Enter CLEOPATRA, attended

 [To SCARUS] Give me thy handTo

 this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,

 Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' th' world,

 Chain mine arm'd neck. Leap thou, attire and all,

 Through proof of harness to my heart, and there

 Ride on the pants triumphing.

 CLEOPATRA. Lord of lords!

 O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from

 The world's great snare uncaught?

 ANTONY. Mine nightingale,

 We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we

 A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can

 Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;

 Commend unto his lips thy favouring handKiss

 it, my warrior- he hath fought to-day

 As if a god in hate of mankind had

 Destroyed in such a shape.

 CLEOPATRA. I'll give thee, friend,

 An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

 ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled

 Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand.

 Through Alexandria make a jolly march;

 Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.

 Had our great palace the capacity

 To camp this host, we all would sup together,

 And drink carouses to the next day's fate,

 Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,

 With brazen din blast you the city's ear;

 Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,

 That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together

 Applauding our approach. Exeunt

 Enter a CENTURION and his company; ENOBARBUS follows

 CENTURION. If we be not reliev'd within this hour,

 We must return to th' court of guard. The night

 Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle

 By th' second hour i' th' morn.

 FIRST WATCH. This last day was

 A shrewd one to's.

 ENOBARBUS. O, bear me witness, nightSECOND

 WATCH. What man is this?

 FIRST WATCH. Stand close and list him.

 ENOBARBUS. Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,

 When men revolted shall upon record

 Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did

 Before thy face repent!

 CENTURION. Enobarbus?

 SECOND WATCH. Peace!

 Hark further.

 ENOBARBUS. O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,

 The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,

 That life, a very rebel to my will,

 May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart

 Against the flint and hardness of my fault,

 Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,

 And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,

 Nobler than my revolt is infamous,

 Forgive me in thine own particular,

 But let the world rank me in register

 A master-leaver and a fugitive!

 O Antony! O Antony! [Dies] FIRST WATCH. Let's speak to him.

 CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks

 May concern Caesar.

 SECOND WATCH. Let's do so. But he sleeps.

 CENTURION. Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his

 Was never yet for sleep.

 FIRST WATCH. Go we to him.

 SECOND WATCH. Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

 FIRST WATCH. Hear you, sir?

 CENTURION. The hand of death hath raught him.

 [Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums

 Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him

 To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour

 Is fully out.

 SECOND WATCH. Come on, then;

 He may recover yet. Exeunt with the body

              Enter ANTONY and SCARUS, with their army

  

 

 ANTONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;

 We please them not by land.

 SCARUS. For both, my lord.

 ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;

 We'd fight there too. But this it is, our foot

 Upon the hills adjoining to the city

 Shall stay with us- Order for sea is given;

 They have put forth the havenWhere

 their appointment we may best discover

 And look on their endeavour. Exeunt

 Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,

 And hold our best advantage. Exeunt

 ANTONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all. I'll bring thee word

 Straight how 'tis like to go. Exit SCARUS. Swallows have built

 In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers

 Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,

 And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony

 Is valiant and dejected; and by starts

 His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear

 Of what he has and has not.

 [Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight]

 Re-enter ANTONY

 ANTONY. All is lost!

 This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.

 My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder

 They cast their caps up and carouse together

 Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou

 Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart

 Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;

 For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,

 I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone. Exit SCARUS O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more!

 Fortune and Antony part here; even here

 Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts

 That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave

 Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets

 On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd

 That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.

 O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charmWhose

 eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,

 Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief endLike

 a right gypsy hath at fast and loose

 Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.

 What, Eros, Eros!

 Enter CLEOPATRA

 Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

 CLEOPATRA. Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?

 ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving

 And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee

 And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;

 Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot

 Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown

 For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let

 Patient Octavia plough thy visage up

 With her prepared nails. Exit CLEOPATRA 'Tis well th'art gone,

 If it be well to live; but better 'twere

 Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death

 Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!

 The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,

 Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;

 Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,

 And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club

 Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.

 To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall

 Under this plot. She dies for't. Eros, ho! Exit

                 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace

  

 

 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

 CLEOPATRA. Help me, my women. O, he is more mad

 Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly

 Was never so emboss'd.

 CHARMIAN. To th'monument!

 There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.

 The soul and body rive not more in parting

 Than greatness going off.

 CLEOPATRA. To th' monument!

 Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;

 Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony'

 And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,

 And ed him medicine, he struck the tin, sending its contents flying. However serious his hurts were they had evidently not mitigated the ferocity of his mood.\ For the three succeeding days he remained in the wagon, stiff with bruises and refusing to speak. Daddy John was detailed to take him his meals, and the doctor dressed his wounds and tried to find the cause of his murderous outburst. But Leff was obdurate. He would express no regret for his action, and would give no reason for it. Once when the questioner asked him if he hated David, he said "Yes." But to the succeeding, "Why did he?" he offered no explanation, said he "didn't know why."\ "Hate never came without a reason," said the physician, curious and puzzled. "Has David wronged you in any way?"\ "What's that to you?" answered the farm boy. "I can hate him if I like, can't I?"\ "Not in my train."\ "Well there are other trains where the men aren't all fools, and the women----"\ He stopped. The doctor's eye held him with a warning gleam.\ "I don't know what's the matter with that boy," he said afterwards in the evening conference. "I can't get at him."\ "Sun mad," Daddy John insisted.\ Courant gave a grunt that conveyed disdain of a question of such small import.\ David couldn't account for it at all.\ Susan said nothing.\ At Green River the Oregon Trail broke from the parent road and slanted off to the northwest. Here the Oregon companies mended their wagons and braced their yokes for the long pull across the broken teeth of mountains to Fort Hall, and from there onward to the new country of great rivers and virgin forests. A large train was starting as the doctor's wagons came down the slope. There was some talk, and a little bartering between the two companies, but time was precious, and the head of the Oregon caravan had begun to roll out when the California party were raising their tents on the river bank.\ It was a sere and sterile prospect. Drab hills rolled in lazy waves toward the river where they reared themselves into bolder forms, a line of ramparts guarding the precious thread of water. The sleek, greenish current ate at the roots of lofty bluffs, striped by bands of umber and orange, and topped with out-croppings of rock as though a vanished race had crowned them with now crumbling fortresses. At their feet, sucking life from the stream, a fringe of alder and willows decked the sallow landscape with a trimming of green.\ Here the doctor's party camped for the night, rising in the morning to find a new defection in their ranks. Leff had gone. Nailed to the mess chest was a slip of paper on which he had traced a few words announcing his happiness to be rid of them, his general dislike of one and all, and his intention to catch up the departed train and go to the Oregon country. This was just what they wanted, the desired had been accomplished without their intervention. But when they discovered that, beside his own saddle horse, he had taken David's, their gladness suffered a check. It was a bad situation, for it left the young man with but one horse, the faithful Ben. There was nothing for it but to abandon the wagon, and give David the doctor's extra mount for a pack animal. With silent pangs the student saw his books thrown on the banks of the river while his keg of whisky, sugar and coffee were stored among the Gillespies' effects. Then they started, a much diminished train--one wagon, a girl, and three mounted men.\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa340\ql\qnatural \f1\b\fs45 \cf0 CHAPTER VII\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa300\ql\qnatural \f0\b0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf0 It was Sunday afternoon, and the doctor and his daughter were sitting by a group of alders on the banks of the little river called Ham's Fork. On the uplands above, the shadows were lengthening, and at intervals a light air caught up swirls of dust and carried them careening away in staggering spirals.\ The doctor was tired and lay stretched on the ground. He looked bloodless and wan, the grizzled beard not able to hide the thinness of his face. The healthful vigor he had found on the prairie had left him, each day's march claiming a dole from his hoarded store of strength. He knew--no one else--that he had never recovered the vitality expended at the time of Bella's illness. The call then had been too strenuous, the depleted reservoir had filled slowly, and now the demands of unremitting toil were draining it of what was left. He said nothing of this, but thought much in his feverish nights, and in the long afternoons when his knees felt weak against the horse's sides. As the silence of each member of the little train was a veil over secret trouble, his had hidden the darkest, the most sinister.\ Susan, sitting beside him, watching him with an anxious eye, noted the languor of his long, dry hands, the network of lines, etched deep on the loose skin of his cheeks. Of late she had been shut in with her own preoccupations, but never too close for the old love and the old habit to force a way through. She had seen a lessening of energy and spirit, asked about it, and received the accustomed answers that came with the quick, brisk cheeriness that now had to be whipped up. She had never seen his dauntless belief in life shaken. Faith and a debonair courage were his message. They were still there, but the effort of the unbroken spirit to maintain them against the body's weakness was suddenly revealed to her and the pathos of it caught at her throat. She leaned forward and passed her hand over his hair, her eyes on his face in a long gaze of almost solemn tenderness.\ "You're worn out," she said.\ "Not a bit of it," he answered stoutly. "You're the most uncomplimentary person I know. I was just thinking what a hardy pioneer I'd become, and that's the way you dash me to the ground."\ She looked at the silvery meshes through which her fingers were laced.\ "It's quite white and there were lots of brown hairs left when we started."\ "That's the Emigrant Trail," he smothered a sigh, and his trouble found words: "It's not for old men, Missy."\ "Old!" scornfully; "you're fifty-three. That's only thirty-two years older than I am. When I'm fifty-three you'll be eighty-five. Then we'll begin to talk about your being old."\ "My little Susan fifty-three!" He moved his head so that he could command her face and dwell upon its blended bloom of olive and clear rose, "With wrinkles here and here," an indicating finger helped him, "and gray hairs all round here, and thick eyebrows, and--" he dropped the hand and his smile softened to reminiscence, "It was only yesterday you were a baby, a little, fat, crowing thing all creases and dimples. Your mother and I used to think everything about you so wonderful that we each secretly believed--and we'd tell each other so when nobody was round--that there \f2\i had \f0\i0 been other babies in the world, but never before one like ours. I don't know but what I think that yet."\ "Silly old doctor-man!" she murmured.\ "And now my baby's a woman with all of life before her. From where you are it seems as if it was never going to end, but when you get where I am and begin to look back, you see that it's just a little journey over before you've got used to the road and struck your gait. We ought to have more time. The first half's just learning and the second's where we put the learning into practice. And we're busy over that when we have to go. It's too short."\ "Our life's going to be long. Out in California we're going to come into a sort of second childhood, be perennials like those larkspurs I had in the garden at home."\ They were silent, thinking of the garden behind the old house in Rochester with walks outlined by shells and edged by long flower beds. The girl looked back on it with a detached interest as an unregretted feature of a past existence in which she had once played her part and that was cut from the present by a chasm never to be bridged. The man held it cherishingly as one of many lovely memories that stretched from this river bank in a strange land back through the years, a link in the long chain.\ "Wasn't it pretty!" she said dreamily, "with the line of hollyhocks against the red brick wall, and the big, bushy pine tree in the corner. Everything was bright except that tree."\ His eyes narrowed in wistful retrospect:\ "It was as if all the shadows in the garden had concentrated there--huddled together in one place so that the rest could be full of color and sunshine. And when Daddy John and I wanted to cut it down you wouldn't let us, cried and stamped, and so, of course, we gave it up. I actually believe you had a sentiment about that tree."\ "I suppose I had, though I don't know exactly what you mean by a sentiment. I loved it because I'd once had such a perfect time up there among the branches. The top had been cut off and a ring of boughs was left round the place, and it made the most comfortable seat, almost like a cradle. One day you went to New York and when you came back you brought me a box of candy. Do you remember it--burnt almonds and chocolate drops with a dog painted on the cover? Well, I wanted to get them at their very best, enjoy them as much as I could, so I climbed to the seat in the top of the pine and ate them there. I can remember distinctly how lovely it was. They tasted better than any candies I've ever had before or since, and I leaned back on the boughs, rocking and eating and looking at the clouds and feeling the wind swaying the trunk. I can shut my eyes and feel again the sense of being entirely happy, sort of limp and forgetful and \f2\i so \f0\i0 contented. I don't know whether it was only the candies, or a combination of things that were just right that day and never combined the same way again. For I tried it often afterwards, with cake and fruit tart and other candies, but it was no good. But I couldn't have the tree cut down, for there was always a hope that I might get the combination right and have that perfectly delightful time once more."\ The doctor's laughter echoed between the banks, and hers fell in with it, though she had told her story with the utmost sedateness.\ "Was there ever such a materialist?" he chuckled. "It all rose from a box of New York candy, and I thought it was sentiment. Twenty-one years old and the same baby, only not quite so fat."\ "Well, it was the truth," she said defensively. "I suppose if I'd left the candy out it would have sounded better."\ "Don't leave the candy out. It was the candy and the truth that made it all Susan's."\ She picked up a stone and threw it in the river, then as she watched its splash: "Doesn't it seem long ago when we were in Rochester?"\ "We left there in April and this is June."\ "Yes, a short time in weeks, but some way or other it seems like ages. When I think of it I feel as if it was at the other side of the world, and I'd grown years and years older since we left. If I go on this way I'll be fully fifty-three when we get to California."\ "What's made you feel so old?"\ "I don't exactly know. I don't think it's because we've gone over so much space, but that has something to do with it. It seems as if the change was more in me."\ "How have you changed?"\ She gathered up the loose stones near her and dropped them from palm to palm, frowning a little in an effort to find words to clothe her vague thought.\ "I don't know that either, or I can't express it. I liked things there that I don't care for any more. They were such babyish things and amounted to nothing, but they seemed important then. Now nothing seems important but things that are--the things that would be on a desert island. And in getting to think that way, in getting so far from what you once were, a person seems to squeeze a good many years into a few weeks." She looked sideways at him, the stones dropping from a slanting palm. "Do you understand me?"\ He nodded:\ "'When I was a child I thought as a child--now I have put away childish things.' Is that it?"\ "Yes, exactly."\ "Then you wouldn't like to go back to the old life?"\ She scattered the stones with an impatient gesture:\ "I couldn't. I'd hate it. I wouldn't squeeze back into the same shape. I'd be all cramped and crowded up. You see every day out here I've been growing wider and wider," she stretched her arms to their length, "widening out to fit these huge, enormous places."\ "The new life will be wide enough for you. You'll grow like a tree, a beautiful, tall, straight tree that has plenty of room for its branches to spread and plenty of sun and air to nourish it. There'll be no crowding or cramping out there. It's good to know you'll be happy in California. In the beginning I had fears."\ She picked up a stone and with its pointed edge drew lines on the dust which seemed to interest her, for she followed them with intent eyes, not answering. He waited for a moment, then said with an undernote of pleading in his voice, "You think you will be happy, dearie?"\ "I--I--don't--know," she stammered. "Nobody can tell. We're not there yet."\ "I can tell." He raised himself on his elbow to watch her face. She knew that he expected to see the maiden's bashful happiness upon it, and the difference between his fond imaginings and the actual facts sickened her with an intolerable sense of deception. She could never tell him, never strike out of him his glad conviction of her contentment.\ "We're going back to the Golden Age, you and I, and David. We'll live as we want, not the way other people want us to. When we get to California we'll build a house somewhere by a river and we'll plant our seeds and have vines growing over it and a garden in the front, and Daddy John will break Julia's spirit and harness her to the plow. Then when the house gets too small--houses have a way of doing that--I'll build a little cabin by the edge of the river, and you and David will have the house to yourselves where the old, white-headed doctor won't be in the way."\ He smiled for the joy of his picture, and she turned her head from him, seeing the prospect through clouded eyes.\ "You'll never go out of my house," she said in a low voice.\ "Other spirits will come into it and fill it up."\ A wish that anything might stop the slow advance to this roseate future choked her. She sat with averted face wrestling with her sick distaste, and heard him say:\ "You don't know how happy you're going to be, my little Missy."\ She could find no answer, and he went on: "You have everything for it, health and youth and a pure heart and David for your mate."\ She had to speak now and said with urgence, trying to encourage herself, since no one else could do it for her,\ "But that's all in the future, a long time from now."\ "Not so very long. We ought to be in California in five or six weeks."\ To have the dreaded reality suddenly brought so close, set at the limit of a few short weeks, grimly waiting at a definite point in the distance, made her repugnance break loose in alarmed words.\ "Longer than that," she cried. "The desert's the hardest place, and we'll go slow, very slow, there."\ "You sound as if you wanted to go slow," he answered, his smile indulgently quizzical, as completely shut away from her, in his man's ignorance, as though no bond of love and blood held them together.\ "No, no, of course not," she faltered. "But I'm not at all sure we'll get through it so easily. I'm making allowance for delays. There are always delays."\ "Yes, there may be delays, but we'll hope to be one of the lucky trains and get through on time."\ She swallowed dryly, her heart gone down too far to be plucked up by futile contradition [Transcriber's note: contradiction?]. He mused a moment, seeking the best method of broaching a subject that had been growing in his mind for the past week. Frankness seemed the most simple, and he said:\ "I've something to suggest to you. I've been thinking of it since we left the Pass. Bridger is a large post. They say there are trains there from all over the West and people of all sorts, and quite often there are missionaries."\ "Missionaries?" in a faint voice.\ "Yes, coming in and going out to the tribes of the Northwest. Suppose we found one there when we arrived?"\ He stopped, watching her.\ "Well?" her eyes slanted sideways in a fixity of attention.\ "Would you marry David? Then we could all go on together."\ Her breath left her and she turned a frightened face on him.\ "Why?" she gasped. "What for?"\ He laid his hand on hers and said quietly:\ "Because, as you say, the hardest part of the journey is yet to come, and I am--well--not a strong man any more. The trip hasn't done for me what I hoped. If by some mischance--if anything should happen to me--then I'd know you'd be taken care of, protected and watched over by some one who could be trusted, whose right it was to do that."\ "Oh, no. Oh, no," she cried in a piercing note of protest. "I couldn't, I couldn't."\ She made as if to rise, then sank back, drawn down by his grasping hand. He thought her reluctance natural, a girl's shrinking at the sudden intrusion of marriage into the pretty comedy of courtship.\ "Susan, I would like it," he pleaded.\ "No," she tried to pull her hand away, as if wishing to draw every particle of self together and shut it all within her own protecting shell.\ "Why not?"\ "It's--it's--I don't want to be married out here in the wilds. I want to wait and marry as other girls do, and have a real wedding and a house to go to. I should hate it. I couldn't. It's like a squaw. You oughtn't to ask it."\ Her terror lent her an unaccustomed subtlety. She eluded the main issue, seizing on objections that did not betray her, but that were reasonable, what might have been expected by the most unsuspicious of men:\ "And as for your being afraid of falling sick in these dreadful places, isn't that all the more reason why I should be free to give all my time and thought to you? If you don't feel so strong, then marrying is the last thing I'd think of doing. I'm going to be with you all the time, closer than I ever was before. No man's going to come between us. Marry David and push you off into the background when you're not well and want me most--that's perfectly ridiculous."\ She meant all she said. It was the truth, but it was the truth reinforced, given a fourfold strength by her own unwillingness. The thought that she had successfully defeated him, pushed the marriage away into an indefinite future, relieved her so that the dread usually evoked by his ill health was swept aside. She turned on him a face, once again bright, all clouds withdrawn, softened into dimpling reassurance.\ "What an idea!" she said. "Men have no sense."\ "Very well, spoiled girl. I suppose we'll have to put it off till we get to California."\ She dropped back full length on the ground, and in the expansion of her relief laid her cheek against the hand that clasped hers.\ "And until we get the house built," she cried, beginning to laugh.\ "And the garden laid out and planted, I suppose?"\ "Of course. And the vines growing over the front porch."\ "Why not over the second story? We'll have a second story by that time."\ "Over the whole house, up to the chimneys."\ They both laughed, a cheerful bass and a gay treble, sweeping out across the unquiet water.\ "It's going to be the Golden Age," she said, in the joy of her respite pressing her lips on the hand she held. "A cottage covered with vines to the roof and you and I and Daddy John inside it."\ "And David, don't forget David."\ "Of course, David," she assented lightly, for David's occupancy was removed to a comfortable distance.\ After supper she and David climbed to the top of the bank to see the sunset. The breeze had dropped, the dust devils died with it. The silence of evening lay like a cool hand on the heated earth. Dusk was softening the hard, bright colors, wiping out the sharpness of stretching shadows the baked reflection of sun on clay. The West blazed above the mountains, but the rest of the sky was a thick, pure blue. Against it to the South, a single peak rose, snow-enameled on a turquoise background.\ Susan felt at peace with the moment and her own soul. She radiated the good humor of one who has faced peril and escaped. Having postponed the event that was to make her David's forever, she felt bound to offer recompense. Her conscience went through one of those processes by which the consciences of women seek ease through atonement, prompting them to actions of a baleful kindliness. Contrition made her tender to the man she did not love. The thought that she had been unfair added a cruel sweetness to her manner.\ He lay on the edge of the bluff beside her, not saying much, for it was happiness to feel her within touch of his hand, amiable and gentle as she had been of late. It would have taken an eye shrewder than David's to have seen into the secret springs of her conduct. He only knew that she had been kinder, friendlier, less withdrawn into the sanctuary of her virgin coldness, round which in the beginning he had hovered. His heart was high, swelled by the promise of her beaming looks and ready smiles. At last, in this drama of slow winning she was drawing closer, shyly melting, her whims and perversities mellowing to the rich, sweet yielding of the ultimate surrender.\ "We ought to be at Fort Bridger now in a few days," he said. "Courant says if all goes well we can make it by Thursday and of course he knows."\ "Courant!" she exclaimed with the familiar note of scorn. "He knows a little of everything, doesn't he?"\ "Why don't you like him, Missy? He's a fine man for the trail."\ "Yes, I dare say he is. But that's not everything."\ "Why don't you like him? Come, tell the truth."\ They had spoken before of her dislike of Courant. She had revealed it more frankly to David than to anyone else. It was one of the subjects over which she could become animated in the weariest hour. She liked to talk to her betrothed about it, to impress it upon him, warming to an eloquence that allayed her own unrest.\ "I don't know why I don't like him. You can't always tell why you like or dislike a person. It's just something that comes and you don't know why."\ "But it seems so childish and unfair. I don't like my girl to be unfair. Has he ever done anything or said anything to you that offended you?"\ She gave a petulant movement: "No, but he thinks so much of himself, and he's hard and has no feeling, and-- Oh, I don't know--it's just that I don't like him."\ David laughed:\ "It's all prejudice. You can't give any real reason."\ "Of course I can't. Those things don't always have reasons. You're always asking for reasons and I never have any to give you."\ "I'll have to teach you to have them."\ She looked slantwise at him smiling. "I'm afraid that will be a great undertaking. I'm very stupid about learning things. You ask father and Daddy John what a terrible task it was getting me educated. The only person that didn't bother about it was this one"--she laid a finger on her chest-- "She never cared in the least."\ "Well I'll begin a second education. When we get settled I'll teach you to reason."\ "Begin now." She folded her hands demurely in her lap and lifting her head back laughed: "Here I am waiting to learn."\ "No. We want more time. I'll wait till we're married."\ Her laughter diminished to a smile that lay on her lips, looking stiff and uncomfortable below the fixity of her eyes.\ "That's such a long way off," she said faintly.\ "Not so very long."\ "Oh, California's hundreds of miles away yet. And then when we get there we've got to find a place to settle, and till the land, and lay out the garden and build a house, quite a nice house; I don't want to live in a cabin. Father and I have just been talking about it. Why it's months and months off yet."\ He did not answer. She had spoken this way to him before, wafting the subject away with evasive words. After a pause he said slowly: "Why need we wait so long?"\ "We must. I'm not going to begin my married life the way the emigrant women do. I want to live decently and be comfortable."\ He broke a sprig off a sage bush and began to pluck it apart. She had receded to her defenses and peeped nervously at him from behind them.\ "Fort Bridger," he said, his eyes on the twig, "is a big place, a sort of rendezvous for all kinds of people."\ She stared at him, her face alert with apprehension, ready to dart into her citadel and lower the drawbridge.\ "Sometimes there are missionaries stopping there."\ "Missionaries?" she exclaimed in a high key. "I hate missionaries!"\ This was a surprising statement. David knew the doctor to be a supporter and believer in the Indian missions, and had often heard his daughter acquiesce in his opinions.\ "Why do you hate them?"\ "I don't know. There's another thing you want a reason for. It's getting cold up here--let's go down by the fire."\ She gathered herself together to rise, but he turned quickly upon her, and his face, while it made her shrink, also arrested her. She had come to dread that expression, persuasion hardened into desperate pleading. It woke in her a shocked repugnance, as though something had been revealed to her that she had no right to see. She felt shame for him, that he must beg where a man should conquer and subdue.\ "Wait a moment," he said. "Why can't one of those missionaries marry us there?"\ She had scrambled to her knees, and snatched at her skirt preparatory to the jump to her feet.\ "No," she said vehemently. "No. What's the matter with you all talking about marriages and missionaries when we're in the middle of the wilds?"\ "Susan," he cried, catching at her dress, "just listen a moment. I could take care of you then, take care of you properly. You'd be my own, to look after and work for. It's seemed to me lately you loved me enough. I wouldn't have suggested such a thing if you were as you were in the beginning. But you seem to care now. You seem as if--as if--it wouldn't be so hard for you to live with me and let me love you."\ She jerked her skirt away and leaped to her feet crying again, "No, David, no. Not for a minute."\ He rose too, very pale, the piece of sage in his hand shaking. They looked at each other, the yellow light clear on both faces. Hers was hard and combative, as if his suggestion had outraged her and she was ready to fight it. Its expression sent a shaft of terror to his soul, for with all his unselfishness he was selfish in his man's longing for her, hungered for her till his hunger had made him blind. Now in a flash of clairvoyance he saw truly, and feeling the joy of life slipping from him, faltered:\ "Have I made a mistake? Don't you care?"\ It was her opportunity, she was master of her fate. But her promise was still a thing that held, the moment had not come when she saw nothing but her own desire, and to gain it would have sacrificed all that stood between. His stricken look, his expression of nerving himself for a blow, pierced her, and her words rushed out in a burst of contrition.\ "Of course, of course, I do. Don't doubt me. Don't. But-- Oh, David, don't torment me. Don't ask anything like that now. I can't, I can't. I'm not ready--not yet."\ Her voice broke and she put her hand to her mouth to hide its trembling. Over it, her eyes, suddenly brimming with tears, looked imploringly into his.\ It was a heart-tearing sight to the lover. He forgot himself and, without knowing what he did, opened his arms to inclose her in an embrace of pity and remorse.\ "Oh, dearest, I'll never ask it till you're willing to come to me," he cried, and saw her back away, with upheld shoulders raised in defense against his hands.\ "I won't touch you," he said, quickly dropping his arms. "Don't draw back from me. If you don't want it I'll never lay a finger on you."\ The rigidity of her attitude relaxed. She turned away her head and wiped her tears on the end of the kerchief knotted round her neck. He stood watching her, struggling with passion and foreboding, reassured and yet with the memory of the seeing moment, chill at his heart.\ Presently she shot a timid glance at him, and met his eyes resting questioningly upon her. Her face was tear stained, a slight, frightened smile on the lips.\ "I'm sorry," she whispered.\ "Susan, do you truly care for me?"\ "Yes," she said, looking down. "Yes--but--let me wait a little while longer."\ "As long as you like. I'll never ask you to marry me till you say you're willing."\ She held out her hand shyly, as if fearing a repulse. He took it, and feeling it relinquished to his with trust and confidence, swore that never again would he disturb her, never demand of her till she was ready to give.\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa340\ql\qnatural \f1\b\fs45 \cf0 CHAPTER VIII\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa300\ql\qnatural \f0\b0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf0 Fort Bridger was like a giant magnet perpetually revolving and sweeping the western half of the country with its rays. They wheeled from the west across the north over the east and down to the south. Ox teams, prairie schooners, pack trains, horsemen came to it from the barren lands that guarded the gates of California, from the tumultuous rivers and fragrant forests of the Oregon country, from the trapper's paths and the thin, icy streams of the Rockies, from the plains where the Platte sung round its sand bars, from the sun-drenched Spanish deserts. All roads led to it, and down each one came the slow coil of the long trains and the pacing files of mounted men. Under its walls they rested and repaired their waste, ere they took the trail again intent on the nation's work of conquest.\ The fort's centripetal attraction had caught the doctor's party, and was drawing it to the focus. They reckoned the days on their fingers and pressed forward with a feverish hurry. They were like wayworn mariners who sight the lights of a port. Dead desires, revived, blew into a glow extinguished vanities. They looked at each other, and for the first time realized how ragged and unkempt they were, then dragged out best clothes from the bottom of their chests and hung their looking-glasses to the limbs of trees. They were coming to the surface after a period of submersion.\ Susan fastened her mirror to the twig on an alder trunk and ransacked her store of finery. It yielded up a new red merino bodice, and the occasion was great enough to warrant breaking into her reserve of hairpins. Then she experimented with her hair, parted and rolled it in the form that had been the fashion in that long dead past--was it twenty years ago?--when she had been a girl in Rochester. She inspected her reflected image with a fearful curiosity, as if expecting to find gray hairs and wrinkles. It was pleasant to see that she looked the same--a trifle thinner may be. And as she noted that her cheeks were not as roundly curved, the fullness of her throat had melted to a more muscular, less creased and creamy firmness, she felt a glow of satisfaction. For in those distant days--twenty-five years ago it must be--she had worried because she was a little \f2\i too \f0\i0 fat. No one could say that now. She stole a look over her shoulder to make sure she was not watched--it seemed an absurdly vain thing to do--and turned back the neck of her blouse. The faintest rise of collar bone showed under the satiny skin, fine as a magnolia petal, the color of faintly tinted meerschaum. She ran her hand across it and it was smooth as curds yielding with an elastic resistance over its bedding of firm flesh. The young girl's pride in her beauty rose, bringing with it a sense of surprise. She had thought it gone forever, and now it still held, the one surviving sensation that connected her with that other Susan Gillespie who had lived a half century ago in Rochester.\ It was the day after this recrudescence of old coquetry that the first tragedy of the trail, the tragedy that was hers alone, smote her.\ The march that morning had been over a high level across which they headed for a small river they would follow to the Fort. Early in the afternoon they saw its course traced in intricate embroidery across the earth's leathern carpet. The road dropped into it, the trail grooved deep between ramparts of clay. On the lip of the descent the wayward Julia, maddened with thirst, plunged forward, her obedient mates followed, and the wagon went hurling down the slant, dust rising like the smoke of an explosion. The men struggled for control and, seized by the contagion of their excitement, the doctor laid hold of a wheel. It jerked him from his feet and flung him sprawling, stunned by the impact, a thin trickle of blood issuing from his lips. The others saw nothing, in the tumult did not hear Susan's cry. When they came back the doctor was lying where he had fallen, and she was sitting beside him wiping his lips with the kerchief she had torn from her neck. She looked up at them and said:\ "It's a hemorrhage."\ Her face shocked them into an understanding of the gravity of the accident. It was swept clean of its dauntless, rosy youth, had stiffened into an unelastic skin surface, taut over rigid muscles. But her eyes were loopholes through which anguish escaped. Bending them on her father a hungry solicitude suffused them, too all-pervading to be denied exit. Turned to the men an agonized questioning took its place. It spoke to them like a cry, a cry of weakness, a cry for succor. It was the first admission of their strength she had ever made, the first look upon them which had said, "You are men, I am a woman. Help me."\ They carried the doctor to the banks of the stream and laid him on a spread robe. He protested that it was nothing, it had happened before, several times. Missy would remember it, last winter in Rochester? Her answering smile was pitiable, a grimace of the lips that went no farther. She felt its failure and turned away plucking at a weed near her. Courant saw the trembling of her hand and the swallowing movement of her throat, bared of its sheltering kerchief. She glanced up with a stealthy side look, fearful that her moment of weakness was spied upon, and saw him, the pity surging from his heart shining on his face like a softening light. She shrank from it, and, as he made an involuntary step toward her, warned him off with a quick gesture. He turned to the camp and set furiously to work, his hands shaking as he drove in the picket pins, his throat dry. He did not dare to look at her again. The desire to snatch her in his arms, to hold her close till he crushed her in a passion of protecting tenderness, made him fear to look at her, to hear her voice, to let the air of her moving body touch him.\ The next morning, while lifting the doctor into the wagon, there was a second hemorrhage. Even the sick man found it difficult to maintain his cheery insouciance. Susan looked pinched, her tongue seemed hardened to the consistency of leather that could not flex for the ready utterance of words. The entire sum of her consciousness was focused on her father. "Breakfast?"--with a blank glance at the speaker--"is it breakfast time?" The men cooked for her and brought her a cup of coffee and her plate of food. She set them on the driver's seat, and when the doctor, keeping his head immovable, and turning smiling eyes upon her, told her to eat she felt for them like a blind woman. It was hard to swallow the coffee, took effort to force it down a channel that was suddenly narrowed to a parched, resistent tube. She would answer no one, seemed to have undergone an ossifying of all faculties turned to the sounds and sights of life. David remembered her state when the doctor had been ill on the Platte. But the exclusion of the outer world was then an obsession of worry, a jealous distraction, as if she resented the well-being of others when hers were forced to suffer. This was different. She did not draw away from him now. She did not seem to see or hear him. Her glance lit unknowing on his face, her hand lay in his, passive as a thing of stone. Sometimes he thought she did not know who he was.\ "Can't we do anything to cheer her or take her mind off it?" he said to Daddy John behind the wagon.\ The old man gave him a glance of tolerant scorn.\ "You can't take a person's mind off the only thing that's in it. She's got nothing inside her but worry. She's filled up with it, level to the top. You might as well try and stop a pail from overflowing that's too full of water."\ They fared on for two interminable, broiling days. The pace was of the slowest, for a jolt or wrench of the wagon might cause another hemorrhage. With a cautious observance of stones and chuck holes they crawled down the road that edged the river. The sun was blinding, beating on the canvas hood till the girl's face was beaded with sweat, and the sick man's blankets were hot against the intenser heat of his body. Outside the world held its breath spellbound in a white dazzle. The river sparkled like a coat of mail, the only unquiet thing on the earth's incandescent surface. When the afternoon declined, shadows crept from the opposite bluffs, slanted across the water, slipped toward the little caravan and engulfed it. Through the front opening Susan watched the road. There was a time when each dust ridge showed a side of bright blue. To half-shut eyes they were like painted stripes weaving toward the distance. Following them to where the trail bent round a buttress, her glance brought up on Courant's mounted figure. He seemed the vanishing point of these converging stripes, the object they were striving toward, the end they aimed for. Reaching him they ceased as though they had accomplished their purpose, led the woman's eyes to him as to a symbolical figure that piloted the train to succor.\ With every hour weakness grew on the doctor, his words were fewer. By the ending of the first day, he lay silent looking out at the vista of bluffs and river, his eyes shining in sunken orbits. As dusk fell Courant dropped back to the wagon and asked Daddy John if the mules could hold the pace all night. Susan heard the whispered conference, and in a moment was kneeling on the seat, her hand clutched like a spread starfish on the old man's shoulder.\ Courant leaned from his saddle to catch the driver's ear with his lowered tones. "With a forced march we can get there to-morrow afternoon. The animals can rest up and we can make him comfortable and maybe find a doctor."\ Her face, lifted to him, was like a transparent medium through which anxiety and hope that was almost pain, shone. She hung on his words and breathed back quick agreement. It would have been the same if he had suggested the impossible, if the angel of the Lord had appeared and barred the way with a flaming sword.\ "Of course they can go all night. They must. We'll walk and ride by turns. That'll lighten the wagon. I'll go and get my horse," and she was out and gone to the back of the train where David rode at the head of the pack animals.\ The night was of a clear blue darkness, suffused with the misty light of stars. Looking back, Courant could see her upright slenderness topping the horse's black shape. When the road lay pale and unshaded behind her he could decipher the curves of her head and shoulders. Then he turned to the trail in front, and her face, as it had been when he first saw her and as it was now, came back to his memory. Once, toward midnight, he drew up till they reached him, her horse's muzzle nosing soft against his pony's flank. He could see the gleam of her eyes, fastened on him, wide and anxious.\ "Get into the wagon and ride," he commanded.\ "Why? He's no worse! He's sleeping."\ "I was thinking of you. This is too hard for you. It'll wear you out."\ "Oh, I'm all right," she said with a slight movement of impatience. "Don't worry about me. Go on."\ He returned to his post and she paced slowly on, keeping level with the wheels. It was very still, only the creaking of the wagon and the hoof beats on the dust. She kept her eyes on his receding shape, watched it disappear in dark turns, then emerge into faintly illumined stretches. It moved steadily, without quickening of gait, a lonely shadow that they followed through the unknown to hope. Her glance hung to it, her ear strained for the thud of his pony's feet, sight and sound of him came to her like a promise of help. He was the one strong human thing in this place of remote skies and dumb unfeeling earth.\ It was late afternoon when the Fort came in sight. A flicker of animation burst up in them as they saw the square of its long, low walls, crowning an eminence above the stream. The bottom lay wide at its feet, the river slipping bright through green meadows sprinkled with an army of cattle. In a vast, irregular circle, a wheel of life with the fort as its hub, spread an engirdling encampment. It was scattered over plain and bottom in dottings of white, here drawn close in clustering agglomerations, there detached in separate spatterings. Coming nearer the white spots grew to wagon hoods and tent roofs, and among them, less easy to discern, were the pointed summits of the lodges with the bunched poles bristling through the top. The air was very still, and into it rose the straight threads of smoke from countless fires, aspiring upwards in slender blue lines to the bluer sky. They lifted and dispersed the smell of burning wood that comes to the wanderer with a message of home, a message that has lain in his blood since the first man struck fire and turned the dry heap of sticks to an altar to be forever fixed as the soul of his habitation.\ They camped in the bottom withdrawn from the closer herding of tents. It was a slow settling, as noiseless as might be, for two at least of their number knew that the doctor was dying. That afternoon Daddy John and Courant had seen the shadow of the great change. Whether Susan saw it they neither knew. She was full of a determined, cold energy, urging them at once to go among the camps and search for a doctor. They went in different directions, leaving her sitting by her father's feet at the raised flap of the tent. Looking back through the gathering dusk Courant could see her, a dark shape, her body drooping in relaxed lines. He thought that she knew.\ When they came back with the word that there was no doctor to be found, darkness was closing in. Night came with noises of men and the twinkling of innumerable lights. The sky, pricked with stars, looked down on an earth alive with answering gleams, as though a segment of its spark-set shield had fallen and lay beneath it, winking back messages in an aerial telegraphy. The fires leaped high or glowed in smoldering mounds, painting the sides of tents, the flanks of ruminating animals, the wheels of wagons, the faces of men and women. Coolness, rest, peace brooded over the great bivouac, with the guardian shape of the Fort above it and the murmur of the river at its feet.\ A lantern, standing on a box by the doctor's side, lit the tent. Through the opening the light from the fire outside poured in, sending shadows scurrying up the canvas walls. Close within call David sat by it, his chin on his knees, his eyes staring at the tongues of flames as they licked the fresh wood. There was nothing now for him to do. He had cooked the supper, and then to ease the pain of his unclaimed sympathies, cleaned the pans, and from a neighboring camp brought a piece of deer meat for Susan. It was the only way he could serve her, and he sat disconsolately looking now at the meat on a tin plate, then toward the tent where she and Daddy John were talking. He could hear the murmur of their voices, see their silhouettes moving on the canvas, gigantic and grotesque. Presently she appeared in the opening, paused there for a last word, and then came toward him.\ "He wants to speak to Daddy John for a moment," she said and dropping on the ground beside him, stared at the fire.\ David looked at her longingly, but he dared not intrude upon her somber abstraction. The voices in the tent rose and fell. Once at a louder phrase from Daddy John she turned her head quickly and listened, a sheaf of strained nerves. The voices dropped again, her eye came back to the light and touched the young man's face. It contained no recognition of him, but he leaped at the chance, making stammering proffer of such aid as he could give.\ "I've got you some supper."\ He lifted the plate, but she shook her head.\ "Let me cook it for you," he pleaded. "You haven't eaten anything since morning."\ "I can't eat," she said, and fell back to her fire-gazing, slipping away from him into the forbidding dumbness of her thoughts. He could only watch her, hoping for a word, an expressed wish. When it came it was, alas! outside his power to gratify:\ "If there had only been a doctor here! That was what I was hoping for."\ And so when she asked for the help he yearned to give, it was his fate that he should meet her longing with a hopeless silence.\ When Daddy John emerged from the tent she leaped to her feet.\ "Well?" she said with low eagerness.\ "Go back to him. He wants you," answered the old man. "I've got something to do for him."\ He made no attempt to touch her, his words and voice were brusque, yet David saw that she responded, softened, showed the ragged wound of her pain to him as she did to no one else. It was an understanding that went beneath all externals. Words were unnecessary between them, heart spoke to heart.\ She returned to the tent and sunk on the skin beside her father. He smiled faintly and stretched a hand for hers, and her fingers slipped between his, cool and strong against the lifeless dryness of his palm. She gave back his smile bravely, her eyes steadfast. She had no desire for tears, no acuteness of sensation. A weight as heavy as the world lay on her, crushing out struggle and resistance. She knew that he was dying. When they told her there was no doctor in the camp her flickering hope had gone out. Now she was prepared to sit by him and wait with a lethargic patience beyond which was nothing.\ He pressed her hand and said: "I've sent Daddy John on a hunt. Do you guess what for?"\ She shook her head feeling no curiosity.\ "The time is short, Missy."\ The living's instinct to fight against the acquiescence of the dying prompted her to the utterance of a sharp "No."\ "I want it all arranged and settled before it's too late. I sent him to see if there was a missionary here."\ She was leaning against the couch of robes, resting on the piled support of the skins. In the pause after his words she slowly drew herself upright, and with her mouth slightly open inhaled a deep breath. Her eyes remained fixed on him, gleaming from the shadow of her brows, and their expression, combined with the amaze of the dropped underlip, gave her a look of wild attention.\ "Why?" she said. The word came obstructed and she repeated it.\ "I want you to marry David here to-night."\ The doctor's watch on a box at the bed head ticked loudly in the silence. They looked at each other unconscious of the length of the pause. Death on the one hand, life pressing for its due on the other, were the only facts they recognized. Hostility, not to the man but to the idea, drove the amazement from her face and hardened its softness to stone.\ "Here, to-night?" she said, her comprehension stimulated by an automatic repetition of his words.\ "Yes. I may not be able to understand tomorrow."\ She moved her head, her glance touching the watch, the lantern, then dropping to the hand curled round her own. It seemed symbolic of the will against which hers was rising in combat. She made an involuntary effort to withdraw her fingers but his closed tighter on them.\ "Why?" she whispered again.\ "Some one must take care of you. I can't leave you alone."\ She answered with stiffened lips: "There's Daddy John."\ "Some one closer than Daddy John. I want to leave you with David."\ Her antagonism rose higher, sweeping over her wretchedness. Worn and strained she had difficulty to keep her lips shut on it, to prevent herself from crying out her outraged protests. All her dormant womanhood, stirring to wakefulness in the last few weeks, broke into life, gathering itself in a passion of revolt, abhorrent of the indignity, ready to flare into vehement refusal. To the dim eyes fastened on her she was merely the girl, reluctant still. He watched her down-drooped face and said:\ "Then I could go in peace. Am I asking too much?"\ She made a negative movement with her head and turned her face away from him.\ "You'll do this for my happiness now?"\ "Anything," she murmured.\ "It will be also for your own."\ He moved his free hand and clasped it on the mound made by their locked fingers. Through the stillness a man's voice singing Zavier's Canadian song came to them. It stopped at the girl's outer ear, but, like a hail from a fading land, penetrated to the man's brain and he stirred.\ "Hist!" he said raising his brows, "there's that French song your mother used to sing."\ The distant voice rose to the plaintive burden and he lay motionless, his eyes filmed with memories. As the present dimmed the past grew clearer. His hold on the moment relaxed and he slipped away from it on a tide of recollection, muttering the words.\ The girl sat mute, her hand cold under his, her being passing in an agonized birth throe from unconsciousness to self-recognition. Her will--its strength till now unguessed--rose resistant, a thing of iron. Love was too strong in her for open opposition, but the instinct to fight, blindly but with caution, for the right to herself was stronger.\ His murmuring died into silence and she looked at him. His eyes were closed, the pressure of his fingers loosened. A light sleep held him, and under its truce she softly withdrew her hand, then stole to the tent door and stood there a waiting moment, stifling her hurried breathing. She saw David lying by the fire, gazing into its smoldering heart. With noiseless feet she skirted the encircling ropes and pegs, and stood, out of range of his eye, on the farther side. Here she stopped, withdrawn from the light that came amber soft through the canvas walls, slipping into shadow when a figure passed, searching the darkness with peering eyes.\ Around her the noises of the camp rose, less sharp than an hour earlier, the night silence gradually hushing them. The sparks and shooting gleams of fires still quivered, imbued with a tenacious life. She had a momentary glimpse of a naked Indian boy flinging loose his blanket, a bronze statue glistening in a leap of flame. Nearer by a woman's figure bent over a kettle black on a bed of embers, then a girl's fire-touched form, with raised arms, shaking down a snake of hair, which broke and grew cloudy under her disturbing hands. A resounding smack sounded on a horse's flank, a low ripple of laughter came tangled with a child's querulous crying, and through the walls of tents and the thickness of smoke the notes of a flute filtered.\ Her ear caught the pad of a footstep on the grass, and her eyes seized on a shadow that grew from dusky uncertainty to a small, bent shape. She waited, suffocated with heartbeats, then made a noiseless pounce on it.\ "Daddy John," she gasped, clutching at him.\ The old man staggered, almost taken off his feet.\ "Is he worse?" he said.\ "He's told me. Did you find anyone?"\ "Yes--two. One's Episcopal--in a train from St. Louis."\ A sound came from her that he did not understand. She gripped at his shoulders as if she were drowning. He thought she was about to swoon and put his arm around her saying:\ "Come back to the tent. You're all on a shake as if you had ague."\ "I can't go back. Don't bring him. Don't bring him. Don't tell father. Not now. I will later, some other time. When we get to California, but not now--not to-night."\ The sentences were cut apart by breaths that broke from her as if she had been running. He was frightened and tried to draw her to the light and see her face.\ "Why, Missy!" he said with scared helplessness, "Why, Missy! What's got you?"\ "Don't get the clergyman. Tell him there isn't any. Tell him you've looked all over. Tell him a lie."\ He guessed the trouble was something more than the grief of the moment, and urged in a whisper:\ "What's the matter now? Go ahead and tell me. I'll stick by you."\ She bent her head back to look into his face.\ "I don't want to marry him now. I can't. I can't. I \f2\i can't \f0\i0 ."\ Her hands on his shoulders shook him with each repetition. The force of the words was heightened by the suppressed tone. They should have been screamed. In these whispered breaths they burst from her like blood from a wound. With the last one her head bowed forward on his shoulder with a movement of burrowing as though she would have crawled up and hidden under his skin, and tears, the most violent he had ever seen her shed, broke from her. They came in bursting sobs, a succession of rending throes that she struggled to stifle, swaying and quivering under their stress.\ He thought of nothing now but this new pain added to the hour's tragedy, and stroked her shoulder with a low "Keep quiet--keep quiet," then leaned his face against her hair and breathed through its tangles.\ "It's all right, I'll do it. I'll say I couldn't find anyone. I'll lie for you, Missy."\ She released him at once, dropped back a step and, lifting a distorted face, gave a nod. He passed on, and she fell on the grass, close to the tent ropes and lay there, hidden by the darkness.\ She did not hear a step approaching from the herded tents. Had she been listening it would have been hard to discern, for the feet were moccasin shod, falling noiseless on the muffling grass. A man's figure with fringes wavering along its outline came round the tent wall. The head was thrust forward, the ear alert for voices. Faring softly his foot struck her and he bent, stretching down a feeling hand. It touched her shoulder, slipped along her side, and gripped at her arm. "What's the matter?" came a deep voice, and feeling the pull on her arm she got to her knees with a strangled whisper for silence. When the light fell across her, he gave a smothered cry, jerked her to her feet and thrust his hand into her hair, drawing her head back till her face was uplifted to his.\ There was no one to see, and he let his eyes feed full upon it, a thief with the coveted treasure in his hands. She seemed unconscious of him, a broken thing without sense or volition, till a stir came from the tent. Then he felt her resist his grasp. She put a hand on his breast and pressed herself back from him.\ "Hush," she breathed. "Daddy John's in there."\ A shadow ran up the canvas wall, bobbing on it, huge and wavering. She turned her head toward it, the tears on her cheeks glazed by the light. He watched her with widened nostrils and immovable eyes. In the mutual suspension of action that held them he could feel her heart beating.\ "Well?" came the doctor's voice.\ The old servant answered:\ "There weren't no parsons anywhere, I've been all over and there's not one."\ "Parsons?" Courant breathed.\ She drew in the fingers spread on his breast with a clawing movement and emitted an inarticulate sound that meant "Hush."\ "Not a clergyman or missionary among all these people?"\ "Not one."\ "We must wait till to-morrow, then."\ "Yes--mebbe there'll be one to-morrow."\ "I hope so."\ Then silence fell and the shadow flickered again on the canvas.\ She made a struggle against Courant's hold, which for a moment he tried to resist, but her fingers plucked against his hand, and she tore herself free and ran to the tent opening. She entered without speaking, threw herself at the foot of the couch, and laid her head against her father's knees.\ "Is that you, Missy?" he said, feeling for her with a groping hand. "Daddy John couldn't find a clergyman."\ "I know," she answered, and lay without moving, her face buried in the folds of the blanket.\ They said no more, and Daddy John stole out of the tent.\ The next day the doctor was too ill to ask for a clergyman, to know or to care. At nightfall he died. The Emigrant Trail had levied its first tribute on them, taken its toll.\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa140\ql\qnatural \cf0 \ \pard\pardeftab720\sa300\ql\qnatural \cf0 END OF PART III\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa140\ql\qnatural \cf0 \ \pard\pardeftab720\sa300\ql\qnatural \cf0 PART IV\ The Desert\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa340\ql\qnatural \f1\b\fs45 \cf0 CHAPTER I\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa300\ql\qnatural \f0\b0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf0 They were camped on the edges of that harsh land which lay between the Great Salt Lake and the Sierra. Behind them the still, heavy reach of water stretched, reflecting in mirrored clearness the mountains crowding on its southern rim. Before them the sage reached out to dim infinities of distance. The Humboldt ran nearby, sunk in a stony bed, its banks matted with growths of alder and willow. The afternoon was drawing to the magical sunset hour. Susan, lying by the door of her tent, could see below the growing western blaze the bowl of the earth filling with the first, liquid oozings of twilight.\ A week ago they had left the Fort. To her it had been a blank space of time, upon which no outer interest had intruded. She had presented an invulnerable surface to all that went on about her, the men's care, the day's incidents, the setting of the way. Cold-eyed and dumb she had moved with them, an inanimate idol, unresponsive to the observances of their worship, aloof from them in somber uncommunicated musings.\ The men respected her sorrow, did her work for her, and let her alone. To them she was set apart in the sanctuary of her mourning, and that her grief should express itself by hours of drooping silence was a thing they accepted without striving to understand. Once or twice David tried to speak to her of her father, but it seemed to rouse in her an irritated and despairing pain. She begged him to desist and got away from him as quickly as she could, climbing into the wagon and lying on the sacks, with bright, unwinking eyes fastened on Daddy John's back. But she did not rest stunned under an unexpected blow as they thought. She was acutely alive, bewildered, but with senses keen, as if the world had taken a dizzying revolution and she had come up panting and clutching among the fragments of what had been her life.\ If there had been some one to whom she could have turned, relieving herself by confession, she might have found solace and set her feet in safer ways. But among the three men she was virtually alone, guarding her secret with that most stubborn of all silences, a girl's in the first wakening of sex. She had a superstitious hope that she could regain peace and self-respect by an act of reparation, and at such moments turned with expiatory passion to the thought of David. She would go to California, live as her father had wished, marry her betrothed, and be as good a wife to him as man could have. And for a space these thoughts brought her ease, consoled her as a compensating act of martyrdom.\ She shunned Courant, rarely addressing him, keeping her horse to the rear of the train where the wagon hood hid him from her. But when his foot fell on the dust beside her, or he dropped back for a word with Daddy John, a stealthy, observant quietude held her frame. She turned her eyes from him as from an unholy sight, but it was useless, for her mental vision called up his figure, painted in yellow and red upon the background of the sage. She knew the expression of the lithe body as it leaned from the saddle, the gnarled hand from which the rein hung loose, the eyes, diamond hard and clear, living sparks set in leathery skin wrinkled against the glare of the waste. She did not lie to herself any more. No delusions could live in this land stripped of all conciliatory deception.\ The night before they left the Fort the men had had a consultation. Sitting apart by the tent she had watched them, David and Daddy John between her and the fire, Courant beyond it. His face, red lit between the hanging locks of hair, his quick eyes, shifting from one man to the other, was keen with a furtive anxiety. At a point in the murmured interview, he had looked beyond them to the darkened spot where she sat. Then Daddy John and David had come to her and told her that if she wished they would turn back, take her home to Rochester, and stay there with her always. There was money enough they said. The doctor had left seven thousand dollars in his chest, and David had three to add to it. It would be ample to live on till the men could set to work and earn a maintenance for them. No word was spoken of her marriage, but it lay in the offing of their argument as the happy finale that the long toil of the return journey and the combination of resources were to prelude.\ The thought of going back had never occurred to her, and shocked her into abrupt refusal. It would be an impossible adaptation to outgrown conditions. She could not conjure up the idea of herself refitted into the broken frame of her girlhood. She told them she would go on, there was nothing now to go back for. Their only course was to keep to the original plan, emigrate to California and settle there. They returned to the fire and told Courant. She could see him with eager gaze listening. Then he smiled and, rising to his feet, sent a bold, exultant glance through the darkness to her. She drew her shawl over her head to shut it out, for she was afraid.\ They rested now on the lip of the desert, gathering their forces for the last lap of the march. There had been no abatement in the pressure of their pace, and Courant had told them it must be kept up. He had heard the story of the Donner party two years before, and the first of September must see them across the Sierra. In the evenings he conferred with Daddy John on these matters and kept a vigilant watch on the animals upon whose condition the success of the journey depended.\ David was not included in these consultations. Both men now realized that he was useless when it came to the rigors of the trail. Of late he had felt a physical and spiritual impairment, that showed in a slighted observance of his share of the labor. He had never learned to cord his pack, and day after day it turned under his horse's belly, discharging its cargo on the ground. The men, growling with irritation, finally took the work from him, not from any pitying consideration, but to prevent further delay.\ He was, in fact, coming to that Valley of Desolation where the body faints and only the spirit's dauntlessness can keep it up and doing. What dauntlessness his spirit once had was gone. He moved wearily, automatically doing his work and doing it ill. The very movements of his hands, slack and fumbling, were an exasperation to the other men, setting their strength to a herculean measure, and giving of it without begrudgment. David saw their anger and did not care. Fatigue made him indifferent, ate into his pride, brought down his self-respect. He plodded on doggedly, the alkali acrid on his lips and burning in his eyeballs, thinking of California, not as the haven of love and dreams, but as a place where there was coolness, water, and rest. When in the dawn he staggered up to the call of "Catch up," and felt for the buckle of his saddle girth, he had a vision of a place under trees by a river where he could sleep and wake and turn to sleep again, and go on repeating the performance all day with no one to shout at him if he was stupid and forgot things.\ Never having had the fine physical endowment of the others all the fires of his being were dying down to smoldering ashes. His love for Susan faded, if not from his heart, from his eyes and lips. She was as dear to him as ever, but now with a devitalized, undemanding affection in which there was something of a child's fretful dependence. He rode beside her not looking at her, contented that she should be there, but with the thought of marriage buried out of sight under the weight of his weariness. It did not figure at all in his mind, which, when roused from apathy, reached forward into the future to gloat upon the dream of sleep. She was grateful for his silence, and they rode side by side, detached from one another, moving in separated worlds of sensation.\ This evening he came across to where she sat, dragging a blanket in an indolent hand. He dropped it beside her and threw himself upon it with a sigh. He was too empty of thought to speak, and lay outstretched, looking at the plain where dusk gathered in shadowless softness. In contrast with his, her state was one of inner tension, strained to the breaking point. Torturings of conscience, fears of herself, the unaccustomed bitterness of condemnation, melted her, and she was ripe for confession. A few understanding words and she would have poured her trouble out to him, less in hope of sympathy than in a craving for relief. The widening gulf would have been bridged and he would have gained the closest hold upon her he had yet had. But if she were more a woman than ever before, dependent, asking for aid, he was less a man, wanting himself to rest on her and have his discomforts made bearable by her consolations.\ She looked at him tentatively. His eyes were closed, the lids curiously dark, and fringed with long lashes like a girl's.\ "Are you asleep?" she asked.\ "No," he answered without raising them. "Only tired."\ She considered for a moment, then said:\ "Have you ever told a lie?"\ "A lie? I don't know. I guess so. Everybody tells lies sometime or other."\ "Not little lies. Serious ones, sinful ones, to people you love."\ "No. I never told that kind. That's a pretty low-down thing to do."\ "Mightn't a person do it--to--to--escape from something they didn't want, something they suddenly--at that particular moment--dreaded and shrank from?"\ "Why couldn't they speak out, say they didn't want to do it? Why did they have to lie?"\ "Perhaps they didn't have time to think, and didn't want to hurt the person who asked it. And--and--if they were willing to do the thing later, sometime in the future, wouldn't that make up for it?"\ "I can't tell. I don't know enough about it. I don't understand what you mean." He turned, trying to make himself more comfortable. "Lord, how hard this ground is! I believe it's solid iron underneath."\ He stretched and curled on the blanket, elongating his body in a mighty yawn which subsided into the solaced note of a groan. "There, that's better. I ache all over to-night."\ She made no answer, looking at the prospect from morose brows. More at ease he returned to the subject and asked, "Who's been telling lies?"\ "I," she answered.\ He gave a short laugh, that drew from her a look of quick protest. He was lying on his side, one arm crooked under his head, his eyes on her in a languid glance where incredulity shone through amusement.\ "Your father told me once you were the most truthful woman he'd ever known, and I agree with him."\ "It was to my father I lied," she answered.\ She began to tremble, for part at least of the story was on her lips. She clasped her shaking hands round her knees, and, not looking at him, said "David," and then stopped, stifled by the difficulties and the longing to speak.\ David answered by laughing outright, a pleasant sound, not guiltless of a suggestion of sleep, a laugh of good nature that refuses to abdicate. It brushed her back into herself as if he had taken her by the shoulders, pushed her into her prison, and slammed the door.\ "That's all imagination," he said. "When some one we love dies we're always thinking things like that--that we neglected them, or slighted them, or told them what wasn't true. They stand out in our memories bigger than all the good things we did. Don't you worry about any lies you ever told your father. You've got nothing to accuse yourself of where he's concerned--or anybody else, either."\ Her heart, that had throbbed wildly as she thought to begin her confession, sunk back to a forlorn beat. He noticed her dejected air, and said comfortingly:\ "Don't be downhearted, Missy. It's been terribly hard for you, but you'll feel better when we get to California, and can live like Christians again."\ "California!" Her intonation told of the changed mind with which she now looked forward to the Promised Land.\ His consolatory intentions died before his own sense of grievance at the toil yet before them.\ "Good Lord, it does seem far--farther than it did in the beginning. I used to be thinking of it all the time then, and how I'd get to work the first moment we arrived. And now I don't care what it's like or think of what I'm going to do. All I want to get there for is to stop this eternal traveling and rest."\ She, too, craved rest, but of the spirit. Her outlook was blacker than his, for it offered none and drew together to a point where her tribulations focused in a final act of self-immolation. There was a pause, and he said, drowsiness now plain in his voice:\ "But we'll be there some day unless we die on the road, and then we can take it easy. The first thing I'm going to do is to get a mattress to sleep on. No more blankets on the ground for me. Do you ever think what it'll be like to sleep in a room again under a roof, a good, waterproof roof, that the sun and the rain can't come through? The way I feel now that's my idea of Paradise."\ She murmured a low response, her thoughts far from the flesh pots of his wearied longing.\ "I think just at this moment," he went on dreamily, "I'd rather have a good sleep and a good meal than anything else in the world. I often dream of 'em, and then Daddy John's kicking me and it's morning and I got to crawl out of the blanket and light the fire. I don't know whether I feel worse at that time or in the evening when we're making the last lap for the camping ground." His voice dropped as if exhausted before the memory of these unendurable moments, then came again with a note of cheer: "Thank God, Courant's with us or I don't believe we'd ever get there."\ She had no reply to make to this. Neither spoke for a space, and then she cautiously stole a glance at him and was relieved to see that he was asleep. Careful to be noiseless she rose, took up a tin water pail and walked to the river.\ The Humboldt rushed through a deep-cut bed, nosing its way between strewings of rock. Up the banks alders and willows grew thick, thrusting roots, hungry for the lean deposits of soil, into cracks and over stony ledges. By the edge the current crisped about a flat rock, and Susan, kneeling on this, dipped in her pail. The water slipped in in a silvery gush which, suddenly seething and bubbling, churned in the hollowed tin, nearly wrenching it from her. She leaned forward, dragging it awkwardly toward her, clutching at an alder stem with her free hand. Her head was bent, but she raised it with a jerk when she heard Courant's voice call, "Wait, I'll do it for you."\ He was on the opposite bank, the trees he had broken through swishing together behind him. She lowered her head without answering, her face suddenly charged with color. Seized by an overmastering desire to escape him, she dragged at the pail, which, caught in the force of the current, leaped and swayed in her hand. She took a hurried upward glimpse, hopeful of his delayed progress, and saw him jump from the bank to a stone in mid-stream. His moccasined feet clung to its slippery surface, and for a moment he oscillated unsteadily, then gained his balance and, laughing, looked at her. For a breathing space each rested motionless, she with strained, outstretched arm, he on the rock, a film of water covering his feet. It was a moment of physical mastery without conscious thought. To each the personality of the other was so perturbing, that without words or touch, the heart beats of both grew harder, and their glances held in a gaze fixed and gleaming. The woman gained her self-possession first, and with it an animal instinct to fly from him, swiftly through the bushes.\ But her flight was delayed. A stick, whirling in the current, caught between the pail's rim and handle and ground against her fingers. With an angry cry she loosed her hold, and the bucket went careening into midstream. That she had come back to harmony with her surroundings was attested by the wail of chagrin with which she greeted the accident. It was the last pail she had left. She watched Courant wade into the water after it, and forgot to run in her anxiety to see if he would get it. "Oh, good!" came from her in a gasp as he caught the handle. But when he came splashing back and set it on the rock beside her, it suddenly lost its importance, and as suddenly she became a prey to low-voiced, down-looking discomfort. A muttered "thank you," was all the words she had for him, and she got to her feet with looks directed to the arrangement of her skirt.\ He stood knee-high in the water watching her, glad of her down-drooped lids, for he could dwell on the bloom that deepened under his eye.\ "You haven't learned the force of running water yet," he said. "It can be very strong sometimes, so strong that a little woman's hand like yours has no power against it."\ "It was because the stick caught in the handle," she muttered, bending for the pail. "It hurt my fingers."\ "You've never guessed that I was called 'Running Water,' have you?"\ "You?" she paused with look arrested in sudden interest. "Who calls you that?"\ "Everybody--you. \f2\i L'eau courante \f0\i0 means running water, doesn't it? That's what you call me."\ In the surprise of the revelation she forgot her unease and looked at him, repeating slowly, "L'eau courante, running water. Why, of course. But it's like an Indian's name."\ "It is an Indian's name. The Blackfeet gave it to me because they said I could run so fast. They were after me once and a man makes the best time he can then. It was a fine race and I won it, and after that they called me, 'The man that goes like Running Water.' The voyageurs and coureurs des bois put it into their lingo and it stuck."\ "But your real name?" she asked, the pail forgotten.\ "Just a common French one, Duchesney, Napoleon Duchesney, if you want to know both ends of it. It was my father's. He was called after the emperor whom my grandfather knew years ago in France. He and Napoleon were students together in the military school at Brienne. In the Revolution they confiscated his lands, and he came out to Louisiana and never wanted to go back." He splashed to the stone and took up the bucket.\ She stood absorbed in the discovery, her child's mind busy over this new conception of him as a man whose birth and station had evidently been so different to the present conditions of his life. When she spoke her mental attitude was na\'95vely displayed.\ "Why didn't you tell before?"\ He shrugged.\ "What was there to tell? The mountain men don't always use their own names."\ The bucket, swayed by the movement, threw a jet of water on her foot. He moved back from her and said, "I like the Indian name best."\ "It is pretty," and in a lower key, as though trying its sound, she repeated softly, " \f2\i L'eau Courante \f0\i0 , Running Water."\ "It's something clear and strong, sometimes shallow and then again deeper than you can guess. And when there's anything in the way, it gathers all its strength and sweeps over it. It's a mighty force. You have to be stronger than it is--and more cunning too--to stop it in the way it wants to go."\ Above their heads the sky glowed in red bars, but down in the stream's hollow the dusk had come, cool and gray. She was suddenly aware of it, noticed the diminished light, and the thickening purplish tones that had robbed the trees and rocks of color. Her warm vitality was invaded by chill that crept inward and touched her spirit with an eerie dread. She turned quickly and ran through the bushes calling back to him, "I must hurry and get supper. They'll be waiting. Bring the pail."\ Courant followed slowly, watching her as she climbed the bank.\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa340\ql\qnatural \f1\b\fs45 \cf0 CHAPTER II\ \pard\pardeftab720\sa300\ql\qnatural \f0\b0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf0 For some days their route followed the river, then they would leave it and strike due west, making marches from spring to spring. The country was as arid as the face of a dead planet, save where the water's course was marked by a line of green. Here and there the sage was broken by bare spaces where the alkali cropped out in a white encrusting. Low mountains edged up about the horizon, thrusting out pointed scarps like capes protruding into slumbrous, gray-green seas. These capes were objects upon which they could fix their eyes, goals to reach and pass. In the blank monotony they offered an interest, something to strive for, something that marked an advance. The mountains never seemed to retreat or come nearer. They encircled the plain in a crumpled wall, the same day after day, a low girdle of volcanic shapes, cleft with moving shadows.\ The sun was the sun of August. It reeled across a sky paled by its ardor, at midday seeming to pause and hang vindictive over the little caravan. Under its fury all color left the blanched earth, all shadows shrunk away to nothing. The train alone, as if in desperate defiance, showed a black blot beneath the wagon, an inky snake sliding over the ground under each horse's sweating belly. The air was like a stretched tissue, strained to the limit of its elasticity, in places parting in delicate, glassy tremblings. Sometimes in the distance the mirage hung brilliant, a blue lake with waves crisping on a yellow shore. They watched it with hungry eyes, a piece of illusion framed by the bleached and bitter reality.\ When evening came the great transformation began. With the first deepening of color the desert's silent heart began to beat in expectation of its hour of beauty. Its bleak detail was lost in shrouding veils and fiery reflection. The earth floor became a golden sea from which the capes reared themselves in shapes of bronze and copper. The ring of mountains in the east flushed to the pink of the topaz, then bending westward shaded from rosy lilac to mauve, and where the sunset backed them, darkened to black. As the hour progressed the stillness grew more profound, the naked levels swept out in wilder glory, inundated by pools of light, lines of fire eating a glowing way through sinks where twilight gathered. With each moment it became a more tremendous spectacle. The solemnity attendant on the passage of a miracle held it. From the sun's mouth the voice of God seemed calling the dead land to life.\ Each night the travelers gazed upon it, ragged forms gilded by its radiance, awed and dumb. Its splendors crushed them, filling them with nostalgic longings. They bore on with eyes that were sick for a sight of some homely, familiar thing that would tell them they were still human, still denizens of a world they knew. The life into which they fitted and had uses was as though perished from the face of the earth. The weak man sunk beneath the burden of its strangeness. Its beauty made no appeal to him. He felt lost and dazed in its iron-ringed ruthlessness, dry as a skeleton by daylight, at night transformed by witchfires of enchantment. The man and woman, in whom vitality was strong, combatted its blighting force, refused to be broken by its power. They desired with vehemence to assert themselves, to rebel, not to submit to the sense of their nothingness. They turned to one another hungry for the life that now was only within themselves. They had passed beyond the limits of the accustomed, were like detached particles gone outside the law of gravity, floating undirected through spaces where they were nothing and had nothing but their bodies, their passions, themselves.\ To a surface observation they would have appeared as stolid as savages, but their nerves were taut as drawn violin strings. Strange self-assertions, violences of temper, were under the skin ready to break out at a jar in the methodical routine. Had the train been larger, its solidarity less complete, furious quarrels would have taken place. With an acknowledged leader whom they believed in and obeyed, the chances of friction were lessened. Three of them could meet the physical demands of the struggle. It was David's fate that, unable to do this, he should fall to a position of feeble uselessness, endurable in a woman, but difficult to put up with in a man.\ One morning Susan was waked by angry voices. An oath shook sleep from her, and thrusting her head out of the wagon where she now slept, she saw the three men standing in a group, rage on Courant's face, disgust on Daddy John's, and on David's an abstraction of aghast dismay that was not unlike despair. To her question Daddy John gave a short answer. David's horses, insecurely picketed, had pulled up their stakes in the night and gone. A memory of the young man's exhaustion the evening before, told the girl the story; David had forgotten to picket them and immediately after supper had fallen asleep. He had evidently been afraid to tell and invented the explanation of dragged picket pins. She did not know whether the men believed it, but she saw by their faces they were in no mood to admit extenuating circumstances. The oath had been Courant's. When he heard her voice he shut his lips on others, but they welled up in his eyes, glowering furiously on the culprit from the jut of drawn brows.\ "What am I to do?" said the unfortunate young man, sending a despairing glance over the prospect. Under his weak misery, rebellious ill humor was visible.\ "Go after them and bring them back."\ Susan saw the leader had difficulty in confining himself to such brief phrases. Dragging a blanket round her shoulders she leaned over the seat. She felt like a woman who enters a quarrel to protect a child.\ "Couldn't we let them go?" she cried. "We've still my father's horse. David can ride it and we can put his things in the wagon."\ "Not another ounce in the wagon," said Daddy John. "The mules are doing their limit now." The wagon was his kingdom over which he ruled an absolute monarch.\ Courant looked at her and spoke curtly, ignoring David. "We can't lose a horse now. We need every one of them. It's not here. It's beyond in the mountains. We've got to get over by the first of September, and we want every animal we have to do it. \f2\i He's \f0\i0 not able to walk."\ He shot a contemptuous glance at David that in less bitter times would have made the young man's blood boil. But David was too far from his normal self to care. He was not able to walk and was glad that Courant understood it.\ "I've got to go after them, I suppose," he said sullenly and turned to where the animals looked on with expectant eyes. "But it's the last time I'll do it. If they go again they'll stay gone."\ There was a mutter from the other men. Susan, full of alarm, scrambled into the back of the wagon and pulled on her clothes. When she emerged David had the doctor's horse saddled and was about to mount. His face, heavy-eyed and unwashed, bore an expression of morose anger, but fatigue spoke pathetically in his slow, lifeless movements, the droop of his thin, high shoulders.\ "David," she called, jumping out over the wheel, "wait."\ He did not look at her or answer, but climbed into the saddle and gathered his rein. She ran toward him crying, "Wait and have some breakfast. I'll get it for you."\ He continued to pay no attention to her, glancing down at his foot as it felt for the stirrup. She stopped short, repulsed by his manner, watching him as he sent a forward look over the tracks of the lost horses. They wound into the distance fading amid the sweep of motionless sage. It would be a long search and the day was already hot. Pity rose above all other feelings, and she said:\ "Have they told you what they're going to do? Whether we'll wait here or go on and have you catch us up?"\ "I don't know what they're going to do and don't care," he answered, and touching the horse with his spur rode away between the brushing bushes.\ She turned to Daddy John, her eyes full of alarmed question.\ "He knows all about it," said the old man with slow phlegm, "I told him myself. There's food and water for him packed on behind the saddle, I done that too. He'd have gone without it just to spite himself. We'll rest here this morning, and if he ain't back by noon move on slow till he catches us up. Don't you worry. He done the wrong thing and he's got to learn."\ No more was said about David, and after breakfast they waited doing the odd tasks that accumulated for their few periods of rest. Susan sat sewing where the wagon cast a cooling slant of shade. Daddy John was beyond her in the sun, his sere old body, from which time had stripped the flesh, leaving only a tenuous bark of muscle, was impervious to the heat. In the growing glare he worked over a broken saddle, the whitening reaches stretching out beyond him to where the mountains waved in a clear blue line as if laid on with one wash of a saturated paint brush. Courant was near him in the shadow of his horse, cleaning a gun, sharp clicks of metal now and then breaking into the stillness.\ As the hours passed the shadow of the wagon shrunk and the girl moved with it till her back was pressed against the wheel. She was making a calico jacket, and as she moved it the crisp material emitted low cracklings. Each rustle was subdued and stealthy, dying quickly away as if it were in conspiracy with the silence and did not want to disturb it. Courant's back was toward her. He had purposely set his face away, but he could hear the furtive whisperings of the stirred calico. He was full of the consciousness of her, and this sound, which carried a picture of her drooped head and moving hands, came with a stealing unquiet, urgently intrusive and persistent. He tried to hold his mind on his work, but his movements slackened, grew intermittent, his ear attentive for the low rustling that crept toward him at intervals like the effervescent approach of waves. Each time he heard it the waves washed deeper to his inner senses and stole something from his restraining will. For days the desert had been stealing from it too. He knew it and was guarded and fearful of it, but this morning he forgot to watch, forgot to care. His reason was drugged by the sound, the stifled, whispering sound that her hands made moving the material from which she fashioned a covering for her body.\ He sat with his back turned to her, his hands loose on the gun, his eyes fixed in an unseeing stare. He did not know what he looked at or that the shadow of the horse had slipped beyond him. When he heard her move his quietness increased to a trancelike suspension of movement, the inner concentration holding every muscle in spellbound rigidness. Suddenly she tore the calico with a keen, rending noise, and it was as if her hands had seized upon and so torn the tension that held him. His fists clinched on the gun barrel, and for a moment the mountain line undulated to his gaze. Had they been alone, speech would have burst from him, but the presence of the old man kept him silent. He bowed his head over the gun, making a pretense of giving it a last inspection, then, surer of himself, leaped to his feet and said gruffly:\ "Let's move on. There's no good waiting here."\ The other two demurred. Susan rose and walked into the glare sweeping the way David had gone. Against the pale background she stood out a vital figure, made up of glowing tints that reached their brightest note in the heated rose of her cheeks and lips. Her dark head with its curly crest of hair was defined as if painted on the opaque blue of the sky. She stood motionless, only her eyes moving as they searched the distance. All of life that remained in the famished land seemed to have flowed into her and found a beautified expression in the rich vitality of her upright form, the flushed bloom of her face. Daddy John bent to pick up the saddle, and the mountain man, safe from espial, looked at her with burning eyes.\ "David's not in sight," she said. "Do you think we'd better go on?"\ "Whether we'd better or not we will," he answered roughly. "Catch up, Daddy John."\ They were accustomed to obeying him like children their master. So without more parley they pulled up stakes, loaded the wagon, and started. As Susan fell back to her place at the rear, she called to Courant:\ "We'll go as slowly as we can. We mustn't get too far ahead. David can't ride hard the way he is now."\ The man growled an answer that she did not hear, and without looking at her took the road.\ They made their evening halt by the river. It had dwindled to a fragile stream which, wandering away into the dryness, would creep feebly to its sink and there disappear, sucked into secret subways that no man knew. To-morrow they would start across the desert, where they could see the road leading straight in a white seam to the west. David had not come. The mules stood stripped of their harness, the wagon rested with dropped tongue, the mess chest was open and pans shone in mingled fire and sunset gleams, but the mysteries of the distance, over which twilight veils were thickening, gave no sign of him. Daddy John built up the desert fire as a beacon--a pile of sage that burned like tinder. It shot high, tossed exultant flames toward the dimmed stars and sent long jets of light into the encircling darkness. Its wavering radiance, red and dancing, touched the scattered objects of the camp, revealing and then losing them as new flame ran along the leaves or charred branches dropped. Outside the night hung, deep and silent. Susan hovered on the outskirts of the glow. Darkness was thickening, creeping from the hills that lay inky-edged against the scarlet of the sky. Once she sent up a high cry of David's name. Courant, busy with his horses, lifted his head and looked at her, scowling over his shoulder.\ "Why are you calling?" he said. "He can see the fire."\ She came back and stood near him, her eyes on him in uneasy scrutiny: "We shouldn't have gone on. We should have waited for him."\ There was questioning and also a suggestion of condemnation in her voice. She was anxious and her tone and manner showed she thought it his fault.\ He bent to loosen a girth.\ "Are you afraid he's lost?" he said, his face against the horse.\ "No. But if he was?"\ "Well! And if he was?"\ The girth was uncinched and he swept saddle and blanket to the ground.\ "We'd have to go back for him, and you say we must lose no time."\ He kicked the things aside and made no answer. Then as he groped for the picket pins he was conscious that she turned again with the nervous movement of worry and swept the plain.\ "He was sick. We oughtn't to have gone on," she repeated, and the note of blame was stronger. "Oh, I wish he'd come!"\ Their conversation had been carried on in a low key. Suddenly Courant, wheeling round on her, spoke in the raised tone of anger.\ "And am I to stop the train because that fool don't know enough or care enough to picket his horses? Is it always to be him? Excuses made and things done for him as if he was a sick girl or a baby. Let him be lost, and stay lost, and be damned to him."\ Daddy John looked up from the sheaf of newly gathered sage with the alertness of a scared monkey. Susan stepped back, feeling suddenly breathless. Courant made a movement as if to follow her, then stopped, his face rived with lines and red with rage. He was shaken by what to her was entirely inexplicable anger, and in her amazement she stared vacantly at him.\ "What's that, what's that?" chirped Daddy John, scrambling to his feet and coming toward them with chin thrust belligerently forward and blinking eyes full of fight.\ Neither spoke to him and he added sharply:\ "Didn't I hear swearing? Who's swearing now?" as if he had his doubts that it might be Susan.\ Courant with a stifled phrase turned from them, picked up his hammer and began driving in the stakes.\ "What was it?" whispered the old man. "What's the matter with him? Is he mad at David?"\ She shook her head, putting a finger on her lip in sign of silence, and moving away to the other side of the fire. She felt the strain in the men and knew it was her place to try and keep the peace. But a sense of forlorn helplessness amid these warring spirits lay heavily on her and she beckoned to the old servant, wanting him near her as one who, no matter how dire the circumstances, would never fail her.\ "Yes, he's angry," she said when they were out of earshot. "I suppose it's about David. But what can we do? We can't make David over into another man, and we can't leave him behind just because he's not as strong as the rest of us. I feel as if we were getting to be savages."\ The old man gave a grunt that had a note of cynical acquiescence, then held up his hand in a signal for quiet. The thud of a horse's hoofs came from the outside night. With a quick word to get the supper ready, she ran forward and stood in the farthest rim of the light waiting for her betrothed.\ David was a pitiable spectacle. The dust lay thick on his face, save round his eyes, whence he had rubbed it, leaving the sockets looking unnaturally sunken and black. His collar was open and his neck rose bare and roped with sinews. There was but one horse at the end of the trail rope. As he slid out of the saddle, he dropped the rope on the ground, saying that the other animal was sick, he had left it dying he thought. He had found them miles off, miles and miles--with a weak wave of his hand toward the south--near an alkaline spring where he supposed they had been drinking. The other couldn't move, this one he had dragged along with him. The men turned their attention to the horse, which, with swollen body and drooping head, looked as if it might soon follow its mate. They touched it, and spoke together, brows knit over the trouble, not paying any attention to David, who, back in the flesh, was sufficiently accounted for.\ Susan was horrified by his appearance. She had never seen him look so much a haggard stranger to himself. He was prostrate with fatigue, and throughout the day he had nursed a sense of bitter injury. Now back among them, seeing the outspread signs of their rest, and with the good smell of their food in his nostrils, this rose to the pitch of hysterical rage, ready to vent itself at the first excuse. The sight of the girl, fresh-skinned from a wash in the river, instead of soothing, further inflamed him. Her glowing well-being seemed bought at his expense. Her words of concern spoke to his sick ear with a note of smug, unfeeling complacence.\ "David, you're half dead. Every thing'll be ready in a minute. Sit down and rest. Here, take my blanket."\ She spread her blanket for him, but he stood still, not answering, staring at her with dull, accusing eyes. Then, with a dazed movement, he pushed his hand over the crown of his head throwing off his hat. The hand was unsteady, and it fell, the hooked forefinger catching in the opening of his shirt, dragging it down and showing his bony breast. If he had been nothing to her she would have pitied him. Sense of wrongs done him made the pity passionate. She went to him, the consoling woman in her eyes, and laid her hand on the one that rested on his chest.\ "David, sit down and rest. Don't move again. I'll get you everything. I never saw you look as you do to-night."\ With an angry movement he threw her hand off.\ "You don't care," he said. "What does it matter to you when you've been comfortable all day? So long as you and the others are all right I don't matter."\ It was so unlike him, his face was so changed and charged with a childish wretchedness, that she felt no check upon her sympathy. She knew it was not David that spoke, but a usurping spirit born of evil days. The other men pricked their ears and listened, but she was indifferent to their watch, and tried again to take his hand, saying, pleadingly:\ "Sit down. When I get your supper you'll be better. I'll have it ready in a few minutes."\ This time he threw her hand off with violence. His face, under its dust mask, flamed with the anger that had been accumulating through the day.\ "Let me alone," he cried, his voice strangled like a wrathful child's. "I don't want anything to do with you. Eat your supper. When I'm ready I'll get mine without any help from you. Let me be."\ He turned from her, and moving over the blanket, stumbled on its folds. The jar was the breaking touch to his overwrought nerves. He staggered, caught his breath with a hiccoughing gasp, and dropping his face into his hands burst into hysterical tears. Then in a sudden abandonment of misery he threw himself on the blanket, buried his head in his folded arms and rending sobs broke from him. For a moment they were absolutely still, staring at him in stupefied surprise. Daddy John, his neck craned round the blaze, surveyed him with bright, sharp eyes of unemotional query, then flopped the bacon pan on the embers, and said:\ "He's all done."\ Courant advanced a step, looked down on him and threw a sidelong glance at Susan, bold with meaning. After her first moment of amazement, she moved to David's side, drew the edge of the blanket over him, touched his head with a light caress, and turned back to the fire. The plates and cups were lying there and she quietly set them out, her eye now and then straying for a needed object, her hand hanging in suspended search then dropping upon it, and noiselessly putting it in its place. Unconsciously they maintained an awed silence, as if they were sitting by the dead. Daddy John turned the bacon with stealthy care, the scrape of his knife on the pan sounding a rude and unseemly intrusion. Upon this scrupulously maintained quietude the man's weeping broke insistent, the stifled CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you know, are greasy.

 TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.

 CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.

 TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance; come.

 CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are perfum'd with civet.

 TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.

 CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.

 TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee! thou art raw.

 CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.

 TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape.

 CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.

 Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper

 ROSALIND. 'From the east to western Inde,

 

                No jewel is like Rosalinde.

                Her worth, being mounted on the wind,

                Through all the world bears Rosalinde.

                All the pictures fairest lin'd

                Are but black to Rosalinde.

                Let no face be kept in mind

                But the fair of Rosalinde.'

  

 

 TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. It is the right

 butter-women's rank to market.

 ROSALIND. Out, fool!

 TOUCHSTONE. For a taste:

 

                  If a hart do lack a hind,

                  Let him seek out Rosalinde.

                  If the cat will after kind,

                  So be sure will Rosalinde.

                  Winter garments must be lin'd,

                  So must slender Rosalinde.

                  They that reap must sheaf and bind,

                  Then to cart with Rosalinde.

                  Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,

                  Such a nut is Rosalinde.

                  He that sweetest rose will find

                  Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.

  

 

 This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect yourself with them?

 ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.

 TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

 ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.

 TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.

 Enter CELIA, with a writing

 ROSALIND. Peace!

 Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.

 CELIA. 'Why should this a desert be?

 For it is unpeopled? No;

 Tongues I'll hang on every tree

 That shall civil sayings show.

 Some, how brief the life of man

 Runs his erring pilgrimage,

 That the streching of a span

 Buckles in his sum of age;

 Some, of violated vows

 'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;

 But upon the fairest boughs,

 Or at every sentence end,

 Will I Rosalinda write,

 Teaching all that read to know

 The quintessence of every sprite

 Heaven would in little show.

 Therefore heaven Nature charg'd

 That one body should be fill'd

 With all graces wide-enlarg'd.

 Nature presently distill'd

 Helen's cheek, but not her heart,

 Cleopatra's majesty,

 Atalanta's better part,

 Sad Lucretia's modesty.

 Thus Rosalinde of many parts

 By heavenly synod was devis'd,

 Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,

 To have the touches dearest priz'd.

 Heaven would that she these gifts should have,

 And I to live and die her slave.'

 ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have patience, good people.'

 CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with him, sirrah.

 TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat; though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.

 Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?

 ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.

 CELIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.

 ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse. CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hang'd and carved upon these trees?

 ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.

 CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?

 ROSALIND. Is it a man?

 CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.

 Change you colour?

 ROSALIND. I prithee, who?

 CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter. ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?

 CELIA. Is it possible?

 ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.

 CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!

 ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottleeither too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.

 CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.

 ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?

 Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?

 CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.

 ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.

 CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant.

 ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true maid.

 CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

 ROSALIND. Orlando?

 CELIA. Orlando.

 ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he? Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one word.

 CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.

 ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled? CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the

 propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropp'd acorn.

 ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth such fruit.

 CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.

 ROSALIND. Proceed.

 CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight. ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.

 CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets

 unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.

 ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.

 CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out of tune.

 ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.

 CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?

 Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES

 ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.

 JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.

 ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.

 JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.

 ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.

 JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.

 ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.

 JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?

 ORLANDO. Yes, just.

 JAQUES. I do not like her name.

 ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christen'd.

 JAQUES. What stature is she of?

 ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.

 JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings? ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.

 JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all our misery.

 ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults.

 JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.

 ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.

 JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you. ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see him.

 JAQUES. There I shall see mine own figure.

 ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.

 JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love. ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.

 Exit JAQUES ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear, forester?

 ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?

 ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?

 ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in the forest.

 ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.

 ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as proper?

 ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.

 ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?

 ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.

 ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal?

 ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles withal.

 ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?

 ROSALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.

 ORLANDO. Who stays it still withal?

 ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.

 ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?

 ROSALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.

 ORLANDO. Are you native of this place?

 ROSALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled. ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.

 ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.

 ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?

 ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow-fault came to match it.

 ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of them.

 ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.

 ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your remedy.

 ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.

 ORLANDO. What were his marks?

 ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue. Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.

 ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love. ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired? ORLANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.

 ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak? ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

 ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.

 ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?

 ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.

 ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.

 ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me.

 ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is. ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way, you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go? ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.

 ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go? Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 The forest

 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind

 TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?

 AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?

 TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.

 JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatch'd house!

 TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.

 AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?

 TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.

 AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical? TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest; now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.

 AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?

 TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

 JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!

 AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.

 TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.

 AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul. TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;

 sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in this place of the forest, and to couple us.

 JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.

 AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!

 TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes Sir Oliver.

 Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

 Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel? MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?

 TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.

 MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful. JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her. TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir? You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be cover'd.

 JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?

 TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.

 JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp. TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.

 JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

 TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;

 We must be married or we must live in bawdry.

 Farewell, good Master Oliver. NotO

 

                 sweet Oliver,

                 O brave Oliver,

  

 

 Leave me not behind thee.

 ButWind

 

                   away,

                 Begone, I say,

             I will not to wedding with thee.

                             Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY

    MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all

      shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit

  

 

 SCENE IV.

 The forest

 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

 ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.

 CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.

 ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?

 CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep. ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.

 CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.

 Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.

 ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.

 CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour. ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.

 CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.

 ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?

 CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

 ROSALIND. Do you think so?

 CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.

 ROSALIND. Not true in love?

 CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.

 ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.

 CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke, your father.

 ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?

 CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes here?

 Enter CORIN

 CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired

 After the shepherd that complain'd of love,

 Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,

 Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess

 That was his mistress.

 CELIA. Well, and what of him?

 CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd

 Between the pale complexion of true love

 And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,

 Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,

 If you will mark it.

 ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!

 The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.

 Bring us to this sight, and you shall say

 I'll prove a busy actor in their play. Exeunt

 SCENE V.

 Another part of the forest

 Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

 SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.

 Say that you love me not; but say not so

 In bitterness. The common executioner,

 Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,

 Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck

 But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be

 Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

 Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance

 PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;

 I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.

 Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.

 'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,

 That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,

 Who shut their coward gates on atomies,

 Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!

 Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;

 And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.

 Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;

 Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,

 Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.

 Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.

 Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains

 Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,

 The cicatrice and capable impressure

 Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,

 Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;

 Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes

 That can do hurt.

 SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,

 If ever- as that ever may be nearYou

 meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,

 Then shall you know the wounds invisible

 That love's keen arrows make.

 PHEBE. But till that time

 Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,

 Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;

 As till that time I shall not pity thee.

 ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your

 mother,

 That you insult, exult, and all at once,

 Over the wretched? What though you have no beautyAs,

 by my faith, I see no more in you

 Than without candle may go dark to bedMust

 you be therefore proud and pitiless?

 Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?

 I see no more in you than in the ordinary

 Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,

 I think she means to tangle my eyes too!

 No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;

 'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,

 Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,

 That can entame my spirits to your worship.

 You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,

 Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?

 You are a thousand times a properer man

 Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you

 That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.

 'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;

 And out of you she sees herself more proper

 Than any of her lineaments can show her.

 But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,

 And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;

 For I must tell you friendly in your ear:

 Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.

 Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;

 Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.

 So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.

 PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;

 I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

 ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?

 PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.

 ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,

 For I am falser than vows made in wine;

 Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,

 'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.

 Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.

 Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,

 And be not proud; though all the world could see,

 None could be so abus'd in sight as he.

 Come, to our flock. Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:

 'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'

 SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.

 PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?

 SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.

 PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

 SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.

 If you do sorrow at my grief in love,

 By giving love, your sorrow and my grief

 Were both extermin'd.

 PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?

 SILVIUS. I would have you.

 PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.

 Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;

 And yet it is not that I bear thee love;

 But since that thou canst talk of love so well,

 Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,

 I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.

 But do not look for further recompense

 Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

 SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,

 And I in such a poverty of grace,

 That I shall think it a most plenteous crop

 To glean the broken ears after the man

 That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then

 A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.

 PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

 SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;

 And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds

 That the old carlot once was master of.

 PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;

 'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.

 But what care I for words? Yet words do well

 When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.

 It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;

 But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.

 He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him

 Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue

 Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.

 He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;

 His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.

 There was a pretty redness in his lip,

 A little riper and more lusty red

 Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.

 There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him

 In parcels as I did, would have gone near

 To fall in love with him; but, for my part,

 I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet

 I have more cause to hate him than to love him;

 For what had he to do to chide at me?

 He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,

 And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.

 I marvel why I answer'd not again;

 But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.

 I'll write to him a very taunting letter,

 And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?

 SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.

 PHEBE. I'll write it straight;

 The matter's in my head and in my heart;

 I will be bitter with him and passing short.

 Go with me, Silvius. Exeunt

 ACT IV. SCENE I.

 The forest

 Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES

 JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.

 ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.

 JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.

 ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.

 JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.

 ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.

 JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's, which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.

 ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.

 JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.

 Enter ORLANDO

 ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to travel for it too.

 ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!

 JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse. ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.

 ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise. ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll warrant him heart-whole.

 ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

 ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be woo'd of a snail.

 ORLANDO. Of a snail!

 ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.

 ORLANDO. What's that?

 ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents the slander of his wife.

 ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous. ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.

 CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.

 ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?

 ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.

 ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.

 ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?

 ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.

 ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress? ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.

 ORLANDO. What, of my suit?

 ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?

 ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking of her.

 ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you. ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.

 ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and, being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.

 ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I protest, her frown might kill me.

 ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me what you will, I will grant it.

 ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.

 ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all. ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?

 ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.

 ORLANDO. What sayest thou?

 ROSALIND. Are you not good?

 ORLANDO. I hope so.

 ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come, sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?

 ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.

 CELIA. I cannot say the words.

 ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-

 CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind? ORLANDO. I will.

 ROSALIND. Ay, but when?

 ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.

 ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.' ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

 ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest; and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions. ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.

 ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have possess'd her.

 ORLANDO. For ever and a day.

 ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou are inclin'd to sleep.

 ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?

 ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.

 ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.

 ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.

 ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit, whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.

 ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?

 ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool!

 ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee. ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!

 ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be with thee again.

 ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?

 ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.

 ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.

 ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind; so, adieu.

 ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let Time try. Adieu. Exit ORLANDO CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.

 ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal. CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.

 ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a shadow, and sigh till he come.

 CELIA. And I'll sleep. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 The forest

 Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters

 JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?

 LORD. Sir, it was I.

 JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose? LORD. Yes, sir.

 JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.

 SONG.

 What shall he have that kill'd the deer?

 His leather skin and horns to wear.

 [The rest shall hear this burden:] Then sing him home.

 Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;

 It was a crest ere thou wast born.

 Thy father's father wore it;

 And thy father bore it.

 The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,

 Is not a thing to laugh to scorn. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 The forest

 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

 ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?

 And here much Orlando!

 CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who comes here.

 Enter SILVIUS

 SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;

 My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.

 I know not the contents; but, as I guess

 By the stern brow and waspish action

 Which she did use as she was writing of it,

 It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,

 I am but as a guiltless messenger.

 ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,

 And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.

 She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;

 She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,

 Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!

 Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;

 Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,

 This is a letter of your own device.

 SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;

 Phebe did write it.

 ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,

 And turn'd into the extremity of love.

 I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,

 A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think

 That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;

 She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.

 I say she never did invent this letter:

 This is a man's invention, and his hand.

 SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.

 ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;

 A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,

 Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain

 Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,

 Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect

 Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

 SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;

 Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.

 ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

 [Reads]

 

              'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,

              That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'

  

 

 Can a woman rail thus?

 SILVIUS. Call you this railing?

 ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,

 Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'

 Did you ever hear such railing?

 

              'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,

              That could do no vengeance to me.'

  

 

 Meaning me a beast.

 

              'If the scorn of your bright eyne

              Have power to raise such love in mine,

              Alack, in me what strange effect

              Would they work in mild aspect!

              Whiles you chid me, I did love;

              How then might your prayers move!

              He that brings this love to the

              Little knows this love in me;

              And by him seal up thy mind,

              Whether that thy youth and kind

              Will the faithful offer take

              Of me and all that I can make;

              Or else by him my love deny,

              And then I'll study how to die.'

  

 

 SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?

 CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd!

 ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to herthat if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

 Exit SILVIUS

 Enter OLIVER

 OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,

 Where in the purlieus of this forest stands

 A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?

 CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.

 The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream

 Left on your right hand brings you to the place.

 But at this hour the house doth keep itself;

 There's none within.

 OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,

 Then should I know you by descriptionSuch

 garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,

 Of female favour, and bestows himself

 Like a ripe sister; the woman low,

 And browner than her brother.' Are not you

 The owner of the house I did inquire for?

 CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

 OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;

 And to that youth he calls his Rosalind

 He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

 ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?

 OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me

 What man I am, and how, and why, and where,

 This handkercher was stain'd.

 CELIA. I pray you, tell it.

 OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,

 He left a promise to return again

 Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,

 Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,

 Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,

 And mark what object did present itself.

 Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,

 And high top bald with dry antiquity,

 A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,

 Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck

 A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,

 Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd

 The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,

 Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,

 And with indented glides did slip away

 Into a bush; under which bush's shade

 A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,

 Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,

 When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis

 The royal disposition of that beast

 To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.

 This seen, Orlando did approach the man,

 And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

 CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;

 And he did render him the most unnatural

 That liv'd amongst men.

 OLIVER. And well he might so do,

 For well I know he was unnatural.

 ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,

 Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

 OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;

 But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,

 And nature, stronger than his just occasion,

 Made him give battle to the lioness,

 Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling

 From miserable slumber I awak'd.

 CELIA. Are you his brother?

 ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?

 CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

 OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame

 To tell you what I was, since my conversion

 So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

 ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?

 OLIVER. By and by.

 When from the first to last, betwixt us two,

 Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,

 As how I came into that desert placeIn

 brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,

 Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,

 Committing me unto my brother's love;

 Who led me instantly unto his cave,

 There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm

 The lioness had torn some flesh away,

 Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,

 And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.

 Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,

 And, after some small space, being strong at heart,

 He sent me hither, stranger as I am,

 To tell this story, that you might excuse

 His broken promise, and to give this napkin,

 Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth

 That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

 [ROSALIND swoons] CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!

 OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

 CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

 OLIVER. Look, he recovers.

 ROSALIND. I would I were at home.

 CELIA. We'll lead you thither.

 I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

 OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!

 You lack a man's heart.

 ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!

 OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.

 ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.

 OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man. ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.

 CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.

 OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back

 How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

 ROSALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my counterfeiting to him. Will you go? Exeunt

 ACT V. SCENE I.

 The forest

 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

 TOUCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey. AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman's saying.

 TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.

 AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the world; here comes the man you mean.

 Enter WILLIAM

 TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.

 WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.

 AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.

 WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.

 TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend? WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.

 TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?

 WILLIAM. William, sir.

 TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?

 WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.

 TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.

 Art rich?

 WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.

 TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?

 WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

 TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid?

 WILLIAM. I do, sir.

 TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?

 WILLIAM. No, sir.

 TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I am he.

 WILLIAM. Which he, sir?

 TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction; will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.

 AUDREY. Do, good William.

 WILLIAM. God rest you merry, sir. Exit

 Enter CORIN

 CORIN. Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away. TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.

 Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 The forest

 Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER

 ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?

 OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.

 ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow. Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.

 Enter ROSALIND

 ROSALIND. God save you, brother.

 OLIVER. And you, fair sister. Exit ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf!

 ORLANDO. It is my arm.

 ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.

 ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

 ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he show'd me your handkercher?

 ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.

 ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.

 ORLANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for. ROSALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?

 ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.

 ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any danger.

 ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?

 ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to Rosalind, if you will.

 Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

 Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.

 PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness

 To show the letter that I writ to you.

 ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study

 To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.

 You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;

 Look upon him, love him; he worships you.

 PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.

 SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;

 And so am I for Phebe.

 PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.

 ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.

 ROSALIND. And I for no woman.

 SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;

 And so am I for Phebe.

 PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.

 ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.

 ROSALIND. And I for no woman.

 SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,

 All made of passion, and all made of wishes;

 All adoration, duty, and observance,

 All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,

 All purity, all trial, all obedience;

 And so am I for Phebe.

 PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.

 ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.

 ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.

 PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

 SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

 ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

 ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?' ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.

 ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can. [To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman, and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you commands.

 SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.

 PHEBE. Nor I.

 ORLANDO. Nor I. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 The forest

 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

 TOUCHSTONE. To-morrow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-morrow will we be married.

 AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come two of the banish'd Duke's pages.

 Enter two PAGES

 FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.

 TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song. SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.

 FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?

 SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies on a horse.

 SONG.

 It was a lover and his lass,

 With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

 That o'er the green corn-field did pass

 In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,

 When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.

 Sweet lovers love the spring.

 Between the acres of the rye,

 With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

 These pretty country folks would lie,

 In the spring time, &c.

 This carol they began that hour,

 With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

 How that a life was but a flower,

 In the spring time, &c.

 And therefore take the present time,

 With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

 For love is crowned with the prime,

 In the spring time, &c.

 TOUCHSTONE. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.

 FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our time.

 TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come, Audrey. Exeunt

 SCENE IV.

 The forest

 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA

 DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy

 Can do all this that he hath promised?

 ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:

 As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.

 Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE

 ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd: You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,

 You will bestow her on Orlando here?

 DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her. ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her? ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.

 ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?

 PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.

 ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,

 You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

 PHEBE. So is the bargain.

 ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?

 SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing. ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.

 Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;

 You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;

 Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,

 Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;

 Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her

 If she refuse me; and from hence I go,

 To make these doubts all even.

 Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy

 Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

 ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him

 Methought he was a brother to your daughter.

 But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,

 And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments

 Of many desperate studies by his uncle,

 Whom he reports to be a great magician,

 Obscured in the circle of this forest.

 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

 JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are call'd fools.

 TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!

 JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.

 TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.

 JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?

 TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.

 JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow. DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.

 TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.

 DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious. TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.

 JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?

 TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

 JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut? TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords and parted.

 JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie? TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If. JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?

 He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.

 DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit:

 Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC

 HYMEN. Then is there mirth in heaven,

 

                When earthly things made even

                  Atone together.

                Good Duke, receive thy daughter;

                Hymen from heaven brought her,

                  Yea, brought her hither,

                That thou mightst join her hand with his,

                Whose heart within his bosom is.

  

 

 ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours. [To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.

 DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter. ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind. PHEBE. If sight and shape be true,

 Why then, my love adieu!

 ROSALIND. I'll have no father, if you be not he;

 I'll have no husband, if you be not he;

 Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

 HYMEN. Peace, ho! I bar confusion;

 

              'Tis I must make conclusion

                Of these most strange events.

              Here's eight that must take hands

              To join in Hymen's bands,

                If truth holds true contents.

              You and you no cross shall part;

              You and you are heart in heart;

              You to his love must accord,

              Or have a woman to your lord;

              You and you are sure together,

              As the winter to foul weather.

              Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,

              Feed yourselves with questioning,

              That reason wonder may diminish,

              How thus we met, and these things finish.

  

                         SONG

              Wedding is great Juno's crown;

                O blessed bond of board and bed!

              'Tis Hymen peoples every town;

                High wedlock then be honoured.

              Honour, high honour, and renown,

              To Hymen, god of every town!

  

 

 DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!

 Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.

 PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;

 Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

 Enter JAQUES de BOYS

 JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two.

 I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,

 That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.

 Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day

 Men of great worth resorted to this forest,

 Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,

 In his own conduct, purposely to take

 His brother here, and put him to the sword;

 And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,

 Where, meeting with an old religious man,

 After some question with him, was converted

 Both from his enterprise and from the world;

 His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,

 And all their lands restor'd to them again

 That were with him exil'd. This to be true

 I do engage my life.

 DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man.

 Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:

 To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,

 A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.

 First, in this forest let us do those ends

 That here were well begun and well begot;

 And after, every of this happy number,

 That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,

 Shall share the good of our returned fortune,

 According to the measure of their states.

 Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,

 And fall into our rustic revelry.

 Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,

 With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.

 JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,

 The Duke hath put on a religious life,

 And thrown into neglect the pompous court.

 JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.

 JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites

 There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

 [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;

 Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.

 [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit; [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;

 [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures; I am for other than for dancing measures.

 DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.

 JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have

 I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave. Exit DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites, As we do trust they'll end, in true delights. [A dance] Exeunt

 EPILOGUE

 EPILOGUE.

 ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you hates them- that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.

 THE COMEDY OF ERRORS

 ACT I. SCENE 1

 A hall in the DUKE'S palace

 Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant

 of Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and other ATTENDANTS

 AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,

 And by the doom of death end woes and all.

 DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;

 I am not partial to infringe our laws.

 The enmity and discord which of late

 Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke

 To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,

 Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,

 Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,

 Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.

 For, since the mortal and intestine jars

 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,

 It hath in solemn synods been decreed,

 Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,

 To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;

 Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus

 Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;

 Again, if any Syracusian born

 Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,

 His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,

 Unless a thousand marks be levied,

 To quit the penalty and to ransom him.

 Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,

 Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;

 Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.

 AEGEON. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,

 My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

 DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause

 Why thou departed'st from thy native home,

 And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.

 AEGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos'd

 Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;

 Yet, that the world may witness that my end

 Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,

 I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.

 In Syracuse was I born, and wed

 Unto a woman, happy but for me,

 And by me, had not our hap been bad.

 With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd

 By prosperous voyages I often made

 To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,

 And the great care of goods at random left,

 Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:

 From whom my absence was not six months old,

 Before herself, almost at fainting under

 The pleasing punishment that women bear,

 Had made provision for her following me,

 And soon and safe arrived where I was.

 There had she not been long but she became

 A joyful mother of two goodly sons;

 And, which was strange, the one so like the other

 As could not be disdnguish'd but by names.

 That very hour, and in the self-same inn,

 A mean woman was delivered

 Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.

 Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,

 I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.

 My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,

 Made daily motions for our home return;

 Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon

 We came aboard.

 A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd

 Before the always-wind-obeying deep

 Gave any tragic instance of our harm:

 But longer did we not retain much hope,

 For what obscured light the heavens did grant

 Did but convey unto our fearful minds

 A doubtful warrant of immediate death;

 Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,

 Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,

 Weeping before for what she saw must come,

 And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,

 That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,

 Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.

 And this it was, for other means was none:

 The sailors sought for safety by our boat,

 And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;

 My wife, more careful for the latter-born,

 Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,

 Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;

 To him one of the other twins was bound,

 Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.

 The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,

 Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,

 Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,

 And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,

 Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.

 At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,

 Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;

 And, by the benefit of his wished light,

 The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered

 Two ships from far making amain to usOf

 Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.

 But ere they came-O, let me say no more!

 Gather the sequel by that went before.

 DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;

 For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

 AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now

 Worthily term'd them merciless to us!

 For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,

 We were encount'red by a mighty rock,

 Which being violently borne upon,

 Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;

 So that, in this unjust divorce of us,

 Fortune had left to both of us alike

 What to delight in, what to sorrow for.

 Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened

 With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,

 Was carried with more speed before the wind;

 And in our sight they three were taken up

 By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.

 At length another ship had seiz'd on us;

 And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,

 Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests,

 And would have reft the fishers of their prey,

 Had not their bark been very slow of sail;

 And therefore homeward did they bend their course.

 Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,

 That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,

 To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

 DUKE. And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,

 Do me the favour to dilate at full

 What have befall'n of them and thee till now.

 AEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,

 At eighteen years became inquisitive

 After his brother, and importun'd me

 That his attendant-so his case was like,

 Reft of his brother, but retain'd his nameMight

 bear him company in the quest of him;

 Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,

 I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.

 Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,

 Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,

 And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;

 Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought

 Or that or any place that harbours men.

 But here must end the story of my life;

 And happy were I in my timely death,

 Could all my travels warrant me they live.

 DUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd

 To bear the extremity of dire mishap!

 Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,

 Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,

 Which princes, would they, may not disannul,

 My soul should sue as advocate for thee.

 But though thou art adjudged to the death,

 And passed sentence may not be recall'd

 But to our honour's great disparagement,

 Yet will I favour thee in what I can.

 Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day

 To seek thy help by beneficial hap.

 Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;

 Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,

 And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.

 Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

 GAOLER. I will, my lord.

 AEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,

 But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

 <Exeunt

 SCENE 2

 The mart

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and FIRST MERCHANT

 FIRST MERCHANT. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,

 Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.

 This very day a Syracusian merchant

 Is apprehended for arrival here;

 And, not being able to buy out his life,

 According to the statute of the town,

 Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.

 There is your money that I had to keep.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host. And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.

 Within this hour it will be dinner-time;

 Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,

 Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,

 And then return and sleep within mine inn;

 For with long travel I am stiff and weary.

 Get thee away.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word, And go indeed, having so good a mean.

 <Exit

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy,

 Lightens my humour with his merry jests.

 What, will you walk with me about the town,

 And then go to my inn and dine with me?

 FIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,

 Of whom I hope to make much benefit;

 I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,

 Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,

 And afterward consort you till bed time.

 My present business calls me from you now.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself, And wander up and down to view the city.

 FIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own content.

 <Exit FIRST MERCHANT

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get.

 I to the world am like a drop of water

 That in the ocean seeks another drop,

 Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,

 Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.

 So I, to find a mother and a brother,

 In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

 Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS

 Here comes the almanac of my true date.

 What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late. The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;

 The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bellMy

 mistress made it one upon my cheek;

 She is so hot because the meat is cold,

 The meat is cold because you come not home,

 You come not home because you have no stomach,

 You have no stomach, having broke your fast;

 But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,

 Are penitent for your default to-day.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray: Where have you left the money that I gave you?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last

 To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?

 The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;

 Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?

 We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust

 So great a charge from thine own custody?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner. I from my mistress come to you in post;

 If I return, I shall be post indeed,

 For she will score your fault upon my pate.

 Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,

 And strike you home without a messenger.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season; Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.

 Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.

 My mistress and her sister stays for you.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,

 Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,

 That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.

 Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate, Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,

 But not a thousand marks between you both.

 If I should pay your worship those again,

 Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix; She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,

 And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

 [Beats him]

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your hands! Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

 <Exit

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other The villain is o'erraught of all my money.

 They say this town is full of cozenage;

 As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,

 Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,

 Soul-killing witches that deform the body,

 Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,

 And many such-like liberties of sin;

 If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.

 I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.

 I greatly fear my money is not safe.

 ACT Il. SCENE 1

 The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

 Enter ADRIANA, wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, with LUCIANA, her sister

 ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd

 That in such haste I sent to seek his master!

 Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

 LUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,

 And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;

 Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.

 A man is master of his liberty;

 Time is their master, and when they see time,

 They'll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.

 ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?

 LUCIANA. Because their business still lies out o' door.

 ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

 LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.

 ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.

 LUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.

 There's nothing situate under heaven's eye

 But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.

 The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,

 Are their males' subjects, and at their controls.

 Man, more divine, the master of all these,

 Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas,

 Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,

 Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,

 Are masters to their females, and their lords;

 Then let your will attend on their accords.

 ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

 LUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

 ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

 LUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

 ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?

 LUCIANA. Till he come home again, I would forbear.

 ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:

 They can be meek that have no other cause.

 A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,

 We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;

 But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain,

 As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.

 So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,

 With urging helpless patience would relieve me;

 But if thou live to see like right bereft,

 This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

 LUCIANA. Well, I will marry one day, but to try.

 Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.

 Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS

 ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.

 ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.

 Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

 LUCIANA. Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could to

 well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.

 ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?

 It seems he hath great care to please his wife.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad. ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad;

 But, sure, he is stark mad.

 When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,

 He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.

 "Tis dinner time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.

 'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.

 'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.

 'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'

 'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.

 'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress;

 I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.'

 LUCIANA. Quoth who?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master.

 'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'

 So that my errand, due unto my tongue,

 I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;

 For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

 ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home?

 For God's sake, send some other messenger.

 ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other beating; Between you I shall have a holy head.

 ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me,

 That like a football you do spurn me thus?

 You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither;

 If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

 <Exit

 LUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

 ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,

 Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.

 Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took

 From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.

 Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?

 If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,

 Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.

 Do their gay vestments his affections bait?

 That's not my fault; he's master of my state.

 What ruins are in me that can be found

 By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground

 Of my defeatures. My decayed fair

 A sunny look of his would soon repair.

 But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,

 And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

 LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.

 ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.

 I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;

 Or else what lets it but he would be here?

 Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;

 Would that alone a love he would detain,

 So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!

 I see the jewel best enamelled

 Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still

 That others touch and, often touching, will

 Where gold; and no man that hath a name

 By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.

 Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,

 I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

 LUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

 <Exeunt

 SCENE 2

 The mart

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave

 Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out.

 By computation and mine host's report

 I could not speak with Dromio since at first

 I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

 How now, sir, is your merry humour alter'd?

 As you love strokes, so jest with me again.

 You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!

 Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!

 My house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,

 That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What answer, sir? When spake I such a word? ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you since you sent me hence, Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt, And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;

 For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this merry vein. What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth? Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

 [Beating him]

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is earnest. Upon what bargain do you give it me?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you,

 Your sauciness will jest upon my love,

 And make a common of my serious hours.

 When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,

 But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.

 If you will jest with me, know my aspect,

 And fashion your demeanour to my looks,

 Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? So you would

 leave battering, I had rather have it a head. An you use

 these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and

 insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say

 every why hath a wherefore.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore, For urging it the second time to me.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason? Well, sir, I thank you.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to

 give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time; there's a time for all things.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that, before you

 were so choleric.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the

 plain bald pate of Father Time himself.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There's no time for a man to recover

 his hair that grows bald by nature.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and

 recover the lost hair of another man.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of

 hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath

 given them in wit.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man

 hath more hair than wit.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the

 wit to lose his hair.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy

 men plain dealers without wit.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;

 yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones too.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there is no time for all things.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,

 and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But, soft, who wafts us yonder?

 Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

 ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.

 Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;

 I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.

 The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow

 That never words were music to thine ear,

 That never object pleasing in thine eye,

 That never touch well welcome to thy hand,

 That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,

 Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee. How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,

 That thou art then estranged from thyself?

 Thyself I call it, being strange to me,

 That, undividable, incorporate,

 Am better than thy dear self's better part.

 Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;

 For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall

 A drop of water in the breaking gulf,

 And take unmingled thence that drop again

 Without addition or diminishing,

 As take from me thyself, and not me too.

 How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,

 Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,

 And that this body, consecrate to thee,

 By ruffian lust should be contaminate!

 Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,

 And hurl the name of husband in my face,

 And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,

 And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,

 And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?

 I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.

 I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;

 My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;

 For if we two be one, and thou play false,

 I do digest the poison of thy flesh,

 Being strumpeted by thy contagion.

 Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;

 I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not: In Ephesus I am but two hours old,

 As strange unto your town as to your talk,

 Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,

 Wants wit in all one word to understand.

 LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang'd with you!

 When were you wont to use my sister thus?

 She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?

 ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from himThat

 he did buffet thee, and in his blows

 Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? What is the course and drift of your compact?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I never saw her till this time. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in all my life.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names, Unless it be by inspiration?

 ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity

 To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,

 Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!

 Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,

 But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.

 Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;

 Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,

 Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,

 Makes me with thy strength to communicate.

 If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,

 Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;

 Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion

 Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme. What, was I married to her in my dream?

 Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?

 What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?

 Until I know this sure uncertainty,

 I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

 LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner. This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!

 We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.

 If we obey them not, this will ensue:

 They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

 LUCIANA. Why prat'st thou to thyself, and answer'st not?

 Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.

 LUCIANA. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass. 'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be

 But I should know her as well as she knows me.

 ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,

 To put the finger in the eye and weep,

 Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.

 Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.

 Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,

 And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.

 Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,

 Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.

 Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell? Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis'd?

 Known unto these, and to myself disguis'd!

 I'll say as they say, and persever so,

 And in this mist at all adventures go.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

 ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

 LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

 ACT III. SCENE 1

 Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.

 Say that I linger'd with you at your shop

 To see the making of her carcanet,

 And that to-morrow you will bring it home.

 But here's a villain that would face me down

 He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,

 And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,

 And that I did deny my wife and house.

 Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know. That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;

 If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Marry, so it doth appear

 By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.

 I should kick, being kick'd; and being at that pass,

 You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

 BALTHAZAR. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish, A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.

 BALTHAZAR. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

 BALTHAZAR. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest. But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;

 Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.

 But, soft, my door is lock'd; go bid them let us in.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn! DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch! Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.

 Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store, When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter?

 My master stays in the street.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Let him walk from whence he came,

 lest he catch cold on's feet.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door! DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when,

 an you'll tell me wherefore.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;

 I have not din'd to-day.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Nor to-day here you must not;

 come again when you may.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out

 from the house I owe?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] The porter for this time,

 sir, and my name is Dromio.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Villain, thou hast stol'n both mine

 office and my name!

 The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.

 If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,

 Thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.

 Enter LUCE, within

 LUCE. [Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.

 LUCE. [Within] Faith, no, he comes too late;

 And so tell your master.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh!

 Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?

 LUCE. [Within] Have at you with another: that's-when? can you tell? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] If thy name be called Luce

 -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope? LUCE. [Within] I thought to have ask'd you.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] And you said no.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. SO, Come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.

 LUCE. [Within] Can you tell for whose sake?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the door hard.

 LUCE. [Within] Let him knock till it ache.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down. LUCE. [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

 Enter ADRIANA, within

 ADRIANA. [Within] Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] By my troth, your town is

 troubled with unruly boys.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might

 have come before.

 ADRIANA. [Within] Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door. DROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore. ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either. BALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither. DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in. DROMIO OF EPHESUS. You would say so, master, if your garments were thin. Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold; It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Break any breaking here,

 and I'll break your knave's pate.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you,

 sir; and words are but wind;

 Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] It seems thou want'st breaking;

 out upon thee, hind!

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's too much 'out upon thee!' pray thee let me in. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Ay, when fowls have no

 feathers and fish have no fin.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow. DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A crow without feather? Master, mean you so? For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather; If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow. BALTHAZAR. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!

 Herein you war against your reputation,

 And draw within the compass of suspect

 Th' unviolated honour of your wife.

 Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,

 Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,

 Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;

 And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse

 Why at this time the doors are made against you.

 Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,

 And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;

 And, about evening, come yourself alone

 To know the reason of this strange restraint.

 If by strong hand you offer to break in

 Now in the stirring passage of the day,

 A vulgar comment will be made of it,

 And that supposed by the common rout

 Against your yet ungalled estimation

 That may with foul intrusion enter in

 And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;

 For slander lives upon succession,

 For ever hous'd where it gets possession.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet, And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.

 I know a wench of excellent discourse,

 Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;

 There will we dine. This woman that I mean,

 My wife-but, I protest, without desertHath

 oftentimes upbraided me withal;

 To her will we to dinner. [To ANGELO] Get you home

 And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.

 Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;

 For there's the house. That chain will I bestowBe

 it for nothing but to spite my wifeUpon

 mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.

 Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,

 I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

 ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense. <Exeunt

 SCENE 2

 Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

 Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

 LUCIANA. And may it be that you have quite forgot

 A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,

 Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?

 Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?

 If you did wed my sister for her wealth,

 Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;

 Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;

 Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;

 Let not my sister read it in your eye;

 Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;

 Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;

 Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;

 Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;

 Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;

 Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?

 What simple thief brags of his own attaint?

 'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed

 And let her read it in thy looks at board;

 Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;

 Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.

 Alas, poor women! make us but believe,

 Being compact of credit, that you love us;

 Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;

 We in your motion turn, and you may move us.

 Then, gentle brother, get you in again;

 Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.

 'Tis holy sport to be a little vain

 When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not, Nor by what wonder you do hit of mineLess

 in your knowledge and your grace you show not

 Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.

 Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;

 Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,

 Smoth'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,

 The folded meaning of your words' deceit.

 Against my soul's pure truth why labour you

 To make it wander in an unknown field?

 Are you a god? Would you create me new?

 Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll yield.

 But if that I am I, then well I know

 Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,

 Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;

 Far more, far more, to you do I decline.

 O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,

 To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.

 Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;

 Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,

 And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;

 And in that glorious supposition think

 He gains by death that hath such means to die.

 Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.

 LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know. LUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by. LUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night. LUCIANA. Why call you me love? Call my sister so.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.

 LUCIANA. That's my sister.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;

 It is thyself, mine own self's better part;

 Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,

 My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,

 My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.

 LUCIANA. All this my sister is, or else should be.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee; Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;

 Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.

 Give me thy hand.

 LUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you still;

 I'll fetch my sister to get her good will.

 <Exit LUCIANA

 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou so fast?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?

 Am I your man? Am I myself?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my

 man, thou art thyself.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and besides myself.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due

 to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one

 that will have me.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, such claim as you would

 lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not

 that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,

 being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one

 as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a

 wondrous fat marriage.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench,

 and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.

 I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn

 Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she'll burn

 week longer than the whole world.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face

 nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may go over shoes in the grime of it.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood

 could not do it.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nell, sir; but her name and three

 quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No longer from head to foot than

 from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by the bogs.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I found it by the barrenness, hard in

 the palm of the hand.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,

 making war against her heir.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I

 could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in her breath.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not look so low. To

 conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; call'd me Dromio; swore I was assur'd to her; told me what privy

 marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the

 mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I,

 amaz'd, ran from her as a witch.

 And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,

 and my heart of steel,

 She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road; An if the wind blow any way from shore,

 I will not harbour in this town to-night.

 If any bark put forth, come to the mart,

 Where I will walk till thou return to me.

 If every one knows us, and we know none,

 'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man would run for life, So fly I from her that would be my wife.

 <Exit

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here, And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.

 She that doth call me husband, even my soul

 Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,

 Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,

 Of such enchanting presence and discourse,

 Hath almost made me traitor to myself;

 But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,

 I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

 Enter ANGELO with the chain

 ANGELO. Master Antipholus!

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.

 ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.

 I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;

 The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this? ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not. ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.

 Go home with it, and please your wife withal;

 And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,

 And then receive my money for the chain.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now, For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

 ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.

 <Exit

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell: But this I think, there's no man is so vain

 That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.

 I see a man here needs not live by shifts,

 When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.

 I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;

 If any ship put out, then straight away.

 ACT IV. SCENE 1

 A public place

 Enter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER

 SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,

 And since I have not much importun'd you;

 Nor now I had not, but that I am bound

 To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.

 Therefore make present satisfaction,

 Or I'll attach you by this officer.

 ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you

 Is growing to me by Antipholus;

 And in the instant that I met with you

 He had of me a chain; at five o'clock

 I shall receive the money for the same.

 Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,

 I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the COURTEZAN'S

 OFFICER. That labour may you save; see where he comes.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow

 Among my wife and her confederates,

 For locking me out of my doors by day.

 But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;

 Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year; I buy a rope. <Exit DROMIO

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you! I promised your presence and the chain;

 But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.

 Belike you thought our love would last too long,

 If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.

 ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note

 How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,

 The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,

 Which doth amount to three odd ducats more

 Than I stand debted to this gentleman.

 I pray you see him presently discharg'd,

 For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money; Besides, I have some business in the town.

 Good signior, take the stranger to my house,

 And with you take the chain, and bid my wife

 Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.

 Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

 ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough. ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have; Or else you may return without your money.

 ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;

 Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,

 And I, to blame, have held him here too long.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine;

 I should have chid you for not bringing it,

 But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.

 SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch. ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money. ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.

 Either send the chain or send by me some token.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath! Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me see it.

 SECOND MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance.

 Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no;

 If not, I'll leave him to the officer.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you? ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain. ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so. ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.

 Consider how it stands upon my credit.

 SECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

 OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me. ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.

 Either consent to pay this sum for me,

 Or I attach you by this officer.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had! Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.

 ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.

 I would not spare my brother in this case,

 If he should scorn me so apparently.

 OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail. But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear

 As all the metal in your shop will answer.

 ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,

 To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.

 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum

 That stays but till her owner comes aboard,

 And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,

 I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought

 The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx.

 The ship is in her trim; the merry wind

 Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an

 But for their owner, master, and yourself.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep, What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope; And told thee to what purpose and what end.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope's end as soonYou

 sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure, And teach your ears to list me with more heed.

 To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;

 Give her this key, and tell her in the desk

 That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry

 There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.

 Tell her I am arrested in the street,

 And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.

 On, officer, to prison till it come.

 <Exeunt all but DROMIO

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is where we din'd,

 Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.

 She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.

 Thither I must, although against my will,

 For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

 <Exit

 SCENE 2

 The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

 Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

 ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?

 Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye

 That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?

 Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?

 What observation mad'st thou in this case

 Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

 LUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.

 ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.

 LUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

 ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

 LUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.

 ADRIANA. And what said he?

 LUCIANA. That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

 ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

 LUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move.

 First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

 ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?

 LUCIANA. Have patience, I beseech.

 ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;

 My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.

 He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,

 Ill-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;

 Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;

 Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

 LUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one?

 No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

 ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,

 And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.

 Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;

 My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Sweet

 now, make haste.

 LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.

 ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell. A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;

 One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;

 A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;

 A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;

 A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands

 The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;

 A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;

 One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell. ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested on the case. ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well; But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell. Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk? ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister. [Exit LUCIANA] This I wonder at: Thus he unknown to me should be in debt.

 Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a stronger thing,

 A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?

 ADRIANA. What, the chain?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone. It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one. ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour meet a sergeant,

 'a turns back for very fear.

 ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason! DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes

 more than he's worth to season.

 Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say

 That Time comes stealing on by night and day?

 If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,

 Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

 Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse

 ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,

 And bring thy master home immediately.

 Come, sister; I am press'd down with conceitConceit,

 my comfort and my injury.

 <Exeunt

 SCENE 3

 The mart

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend;

 And every one doth call me by my name.

 Some tender money to me, some invite me,

 Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,

 Some offer me commodities to buy;

 Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,

 And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,

 And therewithal took measure of my body.

 Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,

 And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me

 for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd? ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,

 but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the

 calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that

 went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give

 them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;

 that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; on that thinks a man always going to bed, and says 'God give you good rest!'

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an

 hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the

 boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I; And here we wander in illusions.

 Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

 Enter a COURTEZAN

 COURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.

 I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.

 Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's

 dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's

 as much to say 'God make me a light wench!' It is written they appear to men like angels of light; light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.

 COURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.

 Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat,

 or bespeak a long spoon.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon

 that must eat with the devil.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping? Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;

 I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

 COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,

 Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,

 And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,

 A nut, a cherry-stone;

 But she, more covetous, would have a chain.

 Master, be wise; an if you give it her,

 The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.

 COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain;

 I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistress, that you know. <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

 COURTEZAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,

 Else would he never so demean himself.

 A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,

 And for the same he promis'd me a chain;

 Both one and other he denies me now.

 The reason that I gather he is mad,

 Besides this present instance of his rage,

 Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner

 Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.

 Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,

 On purpose shut the doors against his way.

 My way is now to hie home to his house,

 And tell his wife that, being lunatic,

 He rush'd into my house and took perforce

 My ring away. This course I fittest choose,

 For forty ducats is too much to lose.

 <Exit

 SCENE 4

 A street

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away. I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,

 To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.

 My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,

 And will not lightly trust the messenger.

 That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,

 I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her cars.

 Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope's-end

 Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.

 How now, sir! Have you that I sent you for?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I return'd.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you. [Beating him]

 OFFICER. Good sir, be patient.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in

 adversity.

 OFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I would I were senseless, sir, that I

 might not feel your blows.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but

 blows, and so is an ass.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it

 by my long 'ears. I have served him from the hour of my

 nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold he heats me with

 beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am

 wak'd with it when I sleep; rais'd with it when I sit; driven out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom'd home

 with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as

 beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me, I shall beg with it from door to door.

 Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHOOLMASTER

 call'd PINCH

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder. DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or rather, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's-end.' ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?

 [Beating him]

 COURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?

 ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.

 Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer:

 Establish him in his true sense again,

 And I will please you what you will demand.

 LUCIANA. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!

 COURTEZAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.

 PINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear. [Striking him]

 PINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous'd within this man,

 To yield possession to my holy prayers,

 And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.

 I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad. ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers? Did this companion with the saffron face

 Revel and feast it at my house to-day,

 Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,

 And I denied to enter in my house?

 ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,

 Where would you had remain'd until this time,

 Free from these slanders and this open shame!

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence? DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witness, That since have felt the vigour of his rage.

 ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?

 PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,

 And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me. ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,

 By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you might, But surely, master, not a rag of money.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats? ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.

 LUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness

 That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

 PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;

 I know it by their pale and deadly looks.

 They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day? And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

 ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold;

 But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.

 ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all, And art confederate with a damned pack

 To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;

 But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes

 That would behold in me this shameful sport.

 ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.

 PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him.

 Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives

 LUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou, I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them

 To make a rescue?

 OFFICER. Masters, let him go;

 He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.

 PINCH. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.

 [They bind DROMIO]

 ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?

 Hast thou delight to see a wretched man

 Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

 OFFICER. He is my prisoner; if I let him go,

 The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.

 ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;

 Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,

 And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.

 Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey'd

 Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you. ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore

 dost thou mad me?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be bound for nothing?

 Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'

 LUCIANA. God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!

 ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.

 <Exeunt all but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OFFICERS, and COURTEZAN

 Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

 OFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?

 ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

 OFFICER. Two hundred ducats.

 ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?

 OFFICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.

 ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

 COURTEZAN. When as your husband, all in rage, to-day

 Came to my house, and took away my ringThe

 ring I saw upon his finger nowStraight

 after did I meet him with a chain.

 ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.

 Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is;

 I long to know the truth hereof at large.

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, with his rapier drawn, and

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

 LUCIANA. God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

 ADRIANA. And come with naked swords.

 Let's call more help to have them bound again.

 OFFICER. Away, they'll kill us!

 <Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE as fast as may be, frighted

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords. DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. She that would be your wife now ran from you. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence. I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, stay here this night; they will

 surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us gold; methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me,

 could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town; Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

 ACT V. SCENE 1

 A street before a priory

 Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO

 ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;

 But I protest he had the chain of me,

 Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

 SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city?

 ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,

 Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,

 Second to none that lives here in the city;

 His word might bear my wealth at any time.

 SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

 ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck

 Which he forswore most monstrously to have.

 Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.

 Signior Andpholus, I wonder much

 That you would put me to this shame and trouble;

 And, not without some scandal to yourself,

 With circumstance and oaths so to deny

 This chain, which now you wear so openly.

 Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,

 You have done wrong to this my honest friend;

 Who, but for staying on our controversy,

 Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.

 This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it. SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it? SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee. Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st

 To walk where any honest men resort.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus; I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty

 Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand.

 SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

 [They draw]

 Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS

 ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.

 Some get within him, take his sword away;

 Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run; for God's sake take a house. This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.

 <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory

 Enter the LADY ABBESS

 ABBESS. Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

 ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.

 Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,

 And bear him home for his recovery.

 ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

 SECOND MERCHANT. I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

 ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?

 ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,

 And much different from the man he was;

 But till this afternoon his passion

 Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

 ABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?

 Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye

 Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?

 A sin prevailing much in youthful men

 Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.

 Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

 ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;

 Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

 ABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.

 ADRIANA. Why, so I did.

 ABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.

 ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.

 ABBESS. Haply in private.

 ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.

 ABBESS. Ay, but not enough.

 ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.

 In bed, he slept not for my urging it;

 At board, he fed not for my urging it;

 Alone, it was the subject of my theme;

 In company, I often glanced it;

 Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

 ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad.

 The venom clamours of a jealous woman

 Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.

 It seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,

 And thereof comes it that his head is light.

 Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:

 Unquiet meals make ill digestions;

 Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;

 And what's a fever but a fit of madness?

 Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.

 Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue

 But moody and dull melancholy,

 Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,

 And at her heels a huge infectious troop

 Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?

 In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,

 To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.

 The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits

 Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.

 LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly,

 When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.

 Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?

 ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.

 Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.

 ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.

 ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

 ABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,

 And it shall privilege him from your hands

 Till I have brought him to his wits again,

 Or lose my labour in assaying it.

 ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,

 Diet his sickness, for it is my office,

 And will have no attorney but myself;

 And therefore let me have him home with me.

 ABBESS. Be patient; for I will not let him stir

 Till I have us'd the approved means I have,

 With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,

 To make of him a formal man again.

 It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,

 A charitable duty of my order;

 Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.

 ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;

 And ill it doth beseem your holiness

 To separate the husband and the wife.

 ABBESS. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.

 <Exit

 LUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.

 ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,

 And never rise until my tears and prayers

 Have won his Grace to come in person hither

 And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.

 SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five; Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person

 Comes this way to the melancholy vale,

 The place of death and sorry execution,

 Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

 ANGELO. Upon what cause?

 SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,

 Who put unluckily into this bay

 Against the laws and statutes of this town,

 Beheaded publicly for his offence.

 ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.

 LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.

 Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded;

 with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS

 DUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly,

 If any friend will pay the sum for him,

 He shall not die; so much we tender him.

 ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!

 DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;

 It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

 ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,

 Who I made lord of me and all I had

 At your important letters-this ill day

 A most outrageous fit of madness took him,

 That desp'rately he hurried through the street,

 With him his bondman all as mad as he,

 Doing displeasure to the citizens

 By rushing in their houses, bearing thence

 Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.

 Once did I get him bound and sent him home,

 Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,

 That here and there his fury had committed.

 Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,

 He broke from those that had the guard of him,

 And with his mad attendant and himself,

 Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,

 Met us again and, madly bent on us,

 Chas'd us away; till, raising of more aid,

 We came again to bind them. Then they fled

 Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;

 And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,

 And will not suffer us to fetch him out,

 Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.

 Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command

 Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

 DUKE. Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars,

 And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,

 When thou didst make him master of thy bed,

 To do him all the grace and good I could.

 Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,

 And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,

 I will determine this before I stir.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!

 My master and his man are both broke loose,

 Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,

 Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;

 And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him

 Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.

 My master preaches patience to him, and the while

 His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;

 And sure, unless you send some present help,

 Between them they will kill the conjurer.

 ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,

 And that is false thou dost report to us.

 MESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;

 I have not breath'd almost since I did see it.

 He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,

 To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.

 [Cry within]

 Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!

 DUKE. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds. ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you

 That he is borne about invisible.

 Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,

 And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS

 ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice! Even for the service that long since I did thee,

 When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took

 Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood

 That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

 AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,

 I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.

 ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there! She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,

 That hath abused and dishonoured me

 Even in the strength and height of injury.

 Beyond imagination is the wrong

 That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

 DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

 ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me, While she with harlots feasted in my house.

 DUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?

 ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,

 To-day did dine together. So befall my soul

 As this is false he burdens me withal!

 LUCIANA. Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night

 But she tells to your Highness simple truth!

 ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.

 In this the madman justly chargeth them.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;

 Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,

 Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,

 Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.

 This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;

 That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,

 Could witness it, for he was with me then;

 Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,

 Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,

 Where Balthazar and I did dine together.

 Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,

 I went to seek him. In the street I met him,

 And in his company that gentleman.

 There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down

 That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,

 Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which

 He did arrest me with an officer.

 I did obey, and sent my peasant home

 For certain ducats; he with none return'd.

 Then fairly I bespoke the officer

 To go in person with me to my house.

 By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more

 Of vile confederates. Along with them

 They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,

 A mere anatomy, a mountebank,

 A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,

 A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,

 A living dead man. This pernicious slave,

 Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,

 And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,

 And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,

 Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together

 They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,

 And in a dark and dankish vault at home

 There left me and my man, both bound together;

 Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,

 I gain'd my freedom, and immediately

 Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech

 To give me ample satisfaction

 For these deep shames and great indignities.

 ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,

 That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.

 DUKE. But had he such a chain of thee, or no?

 ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,

 These people saw the chain about his neck.

 SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him,

 After you first forswore it on the mart;

 And thereupon I drew my sword on you,

 And then you fled into this abbey here,

 From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;

 I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!

 And this is false you burden me withal.

 DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!

 I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.

 If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;

 If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.

 You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here

 Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine. COURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her. DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

 COURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.

 DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither.

 I think you are all mated or stark mad.

 <Exit one to the ABBESS

 AEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:

 Haply I see a friend will save my life

 And pay the sum that may deliver me.

 DUKE. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

 AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?

 And is not that your bondman Dromio?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir, But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords

 Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

 AEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;

 For lately we were bound as you are now.

 You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

 AEGEON. Why look you strange on me? You know me well.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now. AEGEON. O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last;

 And careful hours with time's deformed hand

 Have written strange defeatures in my face.

 But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.

 AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.

 AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and

 whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him. AEGEON. Not know my voice! O time's extremity,

 Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue

 In seven short years that here my only son

 Knows not my feeble key of untun'd cares?

 Though now this grained face of mine be hid

 In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,

 And all the conduits of my blood froze up,

 Yet hath my night of life some memory,

 My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,

 My dull deaf ears a little use to hear;

 All these old witnesses-I cannot errTell

 me thou art my son Antipholus.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.

 AEGEON. But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,

 Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,

 Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in

 the city Can witness with me that it is not so:

 I ne'er saw Syracuse in my life.

 DUKE. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years

 Have I been patron to Antipholus,

 During which time he ne'er saw Syracuse.

 I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

 Re-enter the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

 ABBESS. Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

 [All gather to see them]

 ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

 DUKE. One of these men is genius to the other;

 And so of these. Which is the natural man,

 And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I, Sir, am Dromio; pray let me stay.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, my old master! who hath bound

 ABBESS. Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,

 And gain a husband by his liberty.

 Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man

 That hadst a wife once call'd Aemilia,

 That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.

 O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,

 And speak unto the same Aemilia!

 AEGEON. If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.

 If thou art she, tell me where is that son

 That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

 ABBESS. By men of Epidamnum he and I

 And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;

 But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth

 By force took Dromio and my son from them,

 And me they left with those of Epidamnum.

 What then became of them I cannot tell;

 I to this fortune that you see me in.

 DUKE. Why, here begins his morning story right.

 These two Antipholus', these two so like,

 And these two Dromios, one in semblanceBesides

 her urging of her wreck at seaThese

 are the parents to these children,

 Which accidentally are met together.

 Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse. DUKE. Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord. DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And I with him.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior, Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

 ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.

 ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so; And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,

 Did call me brother. [To LUCIANA] What I told you then, I hope I shall have leisure to make good;

 If this be not a dream I see and hear.

 ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me. ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

 ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,

 By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, none by me.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me.

 I see we still did meet each other's man,

 And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,

 And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here. DUKE. It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

 COURTEZAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

 ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains

 To go with us into the abbey here,

 And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;

 And all that are assembled in this place

 That by this sympathized one day's error

 Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,

 And we shall make full satisfaction.

 Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail

 Of you, my sons; and till this present hour

 My heavy burden ne'er delivered.

 The Duke, my husband, and my children both,

 And you the calendars of their nativity,

 Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;

 After so long grief, such nativity!

 DUKE. With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

 <Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, ANTIPHOLUS OF

 EPHESUS, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard? ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd? DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur. ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio. Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon.

 Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

 <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat friend at your master's house, That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner;

 She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother; I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth.

 Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not I, sir; you are my elder.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. That's a question; how shall we try it?

 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then,

 lead thou first.

 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, then, thus:

 We came into the world like brother and brother,

 And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

 <Exeunt

 SCENE:

 Rome and the neighbourhood; Corioli and the neighbourhood; Antium

 ACT I. SCENE I.

 Rome. A street

 Enter a company of mutinous citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons

 FIRST CITIZEN. Before we proceed any further, hear me speak. ALL. Speak, speak.

 FIRST CITIZEN. YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish? ALL. Resolv'd, resolv'd.

 FIRST CITIZEN. First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

 ALL. We know't, we know't.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price. Is't a verdict?

 ALL. No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!

 SECOND CITIZEN. One word, good citizens.

 FIRST CITIZEN. We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

 SECOND CITIZEN. Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius? FIRST CITIZEN. Against him first; he's a very dog to the

 commonalty.

 SECOND CITIZEN. Consider you what services he has done for his country?

 FIRST CITIZEN. Very well, and could be content to give him good report for't but that he pays himself with being proud. SECOND CITIZEN. Nay, but speak not maliciously.

 FIRST CITIZEN. I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue. SECOND CITIZEN. What he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

 FIRST CITIZEN. If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. [Shouts within] What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!

 ALL. Come, come.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Soft! who comes here?

 Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA

 SECOND CITIZEN. Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd the people.

 FIRST CITIZEN. He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so! MENENIUS. What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.

 MENENIUS. Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, Will you undo yourselves?

 FIRST CITIZEN. We cannot, sir; we are undone already.

 MENENIUS. I tell you, friends, most charitable care

 Have the patricians of you. For your wants,

 Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well

 Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them

 Against the Roman state; whose course will on

 The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs

 Of more strong link asunder than can ever

 Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,

 The gods, not the patricians, make it, and

 Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,

 You are transported by calamity

 Thither where more attends you; and you slander

 The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,

 When you curse them as enemies.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear us.

 MENENIUS. Either you must

 Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,

 Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you

 A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;

 But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture

 To stale't a little more.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver. MENENIUS. There was a time when all the body's members

 Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:

 That only like a gulf it did remain

 I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,

 Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing

 Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments

 Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,

 And, mutually participate, did minister

 Unto the appetite and affection common

 Of the whole body. The belly answer'dFIRST

 CITIZEN. Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

 MENENIUS. Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,

 Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thusFor

 look you, I may make the belly smile

 As well as speak- it tauntingly replied

 To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts

 That envied his receipt; even so most fitly

 As you malign our senators for that

 They are not such as you.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Your belly's answer- What?

 The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,

 The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,

 Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,

 With other muniments and petty helps

 Is this our fabric, if that theyMENENIUS.

 What then?

 Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?

 FIRST CITIZEN. Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd, Who is the sink o' th' bodyMENENIUS.

 Well, what then?

 FIRST CITIZEN. The former agents, if they did complain,

 What could the belly answer?

 MENENIUS. I will tell you;

 If you'll bestow a small- of what you have littlePatience

 awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Y'are long about it.

 MENENIUS. Note me this, good friend:

 Your most grave belly was deliberate,

 Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.

 'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he

 'That I receive the general food at first

 Which you do live upon; and fit it is,

 Because I am the storehouse and the shop

 Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,

 I send it through the rivers of your blood,

 Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain; And, through the cranks and offices of man,

 The strongest nerves and small inferior veins

 From me receive that natural competency

 Whereby they live. And though that all at once

 You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, sir; well, well.

 MENENIUS. 'Though all at once cannot

 See what I do deliver out to each,

 Yet I can make my audit up, that all

 From me do back receive the flour of all,

 And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?

 FIRST CITIZEN. It was an answer. How apply you this?

 MENENIUS. The senators of Rome are this good belly,

 And you the mutinous members; for, examine

 Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly

 Touching the weal o' th' common, you shall find

 No public benefit which you receive

 But it proceeds or comes from them to you,

 And no way from yourselves. What do you think,

 You, the great toe of this assembly?

 FIRST CITIZEN. I the great toe? Why the great toe?

 MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest, Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.

 Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,

 Lead'st first to win some vantage.

 But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.

 Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;

 The one side must have bale.

 Enter CAIUS MARCIUS

 Hail, noble Marcius!

 MARCIUS. Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,

 Make yourselves scabs?

 FIRST CITIZEN. We have ever your good word.

 MARCIUS. He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,

 That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,

 The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,

 Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;

 Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,

 Than is the coal of fire upon the ice

 Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is

 To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,

 And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness

 Deserves your hate; and your affections are

 A sick man's appetite, who desires most that

 Which would increase his evil. He that depends

 Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,

 And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?

 With every minute you do change a mind

 And call him noble that was now your hate,

 Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter

 That in these several places of the city

 You cry against the noble Senate, who,

 Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else

 Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

 MENENIUS. For corn at their own rates, whereof they say

 The city is well stor'd.

 MARCIUS. Hang 'em! They say!

 They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know

 What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,

 Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,

 And feebling such as stand not in their liking

 Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough! Would the nobility lay aside their ruth

 And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry

 With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high

 As I could pick my lance.

 MENENIUS. Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;

 For though abundantly they lack discretion,

 Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,

 What says the other troop?

 MARCIUS. They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!

 They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbsThat

 hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,

 That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not

 Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds

 They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,

 And a petition granted them- a strange one,

 To break the heart of generosity

 And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps

 As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,

 Shouting their emulation.

 MENENIUS. What is granted them?

 MARCIUS. Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,

 Of their own choice. One's Junius BrutusSicinius

 Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!

 The rabble should have first unroof'd the city

 Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time

 Win upon power and throw forth greater themes

 For insurrection's arguing.

 MENENIUS. This is strange.

 MARCIUS. Go get you home, you fragments.

 Enter a MESSENGER, hastily

 MESSENGER. Where's Caius Marcius?

 MARCIUS. Here. What's the matter?

 MESSENGER. The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

 MARCIUS. I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent

 Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

 Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with other SENATORS;

 JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS

 FIRST SENATOR. Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us: The Volsces are in arms.

 MARCIUS. They have a leader,

 Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.

 I sin in envying his nobility;

 And were I anything but what I am,

 I would wish me only he.

 COMINIUS. You have fought together?

 MARCIUS. Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he

 Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make

 Only my wars with him. He is a lion

 That I am proud to hunt.

 FIRST SENATOR. Then, worthy Marcius,

 Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

 COMINIUS. It is your former promise.

 MARCIUS. Sir, it is;

 And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou

 Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.

 What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?

 LARTIUS. No, Caius Marcius;

 I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other

 Ere stay behind this business.

 MENENIUS. O, true bred!

 FIRST SENATOR. Your company to th' Capitol; where, I know, Our greatest friends attend us.

 LARTIUS. [To COMINIUS] Lead you on.

 [To MARCIUS] Follow Cominius; we must follow you;

 Right worthy you priority.

 COMINIUS. Noble Marcius!

 FIRST SENATOR. [To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone. MARCIUS. Nay, let them follow.

 The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither

 To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,

 Your valour puts well forth; pray follow.

 Ciitzens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS SICINIUS. Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

 BRUTUS. He has no equal.

 SICINIUS. When we were chosen tribunes for the peopleBRUTUS.

 Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

 SICINIUS. Nay, but his taunts!

 BRUTUS. Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.

 SICINIUS. Bemock the modest moon.

 BRUTUS. The present wars devour him! He is grown

 Too proud to be so valiant.

 SICINIUS. Such a nature,

 Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow

 Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder

 His insolence can brook to be commanded

 Under Cominius.

 BRUTUS. Fame, at the which he aimsIn

 whom already he is well grac'd- cannot

 Better be held nor more attain'd than by

 A place below the first; for what miscarries

 Shall be the general's fault, though he perform

 To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure

 Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he

 Had borne the business!'

 SICINIUS. Besides, if things go well,

 Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall

 Of his demerits rob Cominius.

 BRUTUS. Come.

 Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,

 Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults

 To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed

 In aught he merit not.

 SICINIUS. Let's hence and hear

 How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,

 More than his singularity, he goes

 Upon this present action.

 BRUTUS. Let's along. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Corioli. The Senate House.

 Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with SENATORS of Corioli

 FIRST SENATOR. So, your opinion is, Aufidius,

 That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels

 And know how we proceed.

 AUFIDIUS. Is it not yours?

 What ever have been thought on in this state

 That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome

 Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone

 Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think

 I have the letter here;.yes, here it is:

 [Reads] 'They have press'd a power, but it is not known Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;

 The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,

 Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,

 Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,

 And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,

 These three lead on this preparation

 Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you;

 Consider of it.'

 FIRST SENATOR. Our army's in the field;

 We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready

 To answer us.

 AUFIDIUS. Nor did you think it folly

 To keep your great pretences veil'd till when

 They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching, It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery

 We shall be short'ned in our aim, which was

 To take in many towns ere almost Rome

 Should know we were afoot.

 SECOND SENATOR. Noble Aufidius,

 Take your commission; hie you to your bands;

 Let us alone to guard Corioli.

 If they set down before's, for the remove

 Bring up your army; but I think you'll find

 Th' have not prepar'd for us.

 AUFIDIUS. O, doubt not that!

 I speak from certainties. Nay more,

 Some parcels of their power are forth already,

 And only hitherward. I leave your honours.

 If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,

 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike

 Till one can do no more.

 ALL. The gods assist you!

 AUFIDIUS. And keep your honours safe!

 FIRST SENATOR. Farewell.

 SECOND SENATOR. Farewell.

 ALL. Farewell. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Rome. MARCIUS' house

 Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA, mother and wife to MARCIUS;

 they set them down on two low stools and sew

 VOLUMNIA. I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a personthat it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he return'd his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.

 VIRGILIA. But had he died in the business, madam, how then? VOLUMNIA. Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

 Enter a GENTLEWOMAN

 GENTLEWOMAN. Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you. VIRGILIA. Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.

 VOLUMNIA. Indeed you shall not.

 Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum;

 See him pluck Aufidius down by th' hair;

 As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.

 Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:

 'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,

 Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow

 With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,

 Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow

 Or all or lose his hire.

 VIRGILIA. His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!

 VOLUMNIA. Away, you fool! It more becomes a man

 Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,

 When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier

 Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood

 At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria

 We are fit to bid her welcome. Exit GENTLEWOMAN VIRGILIA. Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

 VOLUMNIA. He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee

 And tread upon his neck.

 Re-enter GENTLEWOMAN, With VALERIA and an usher

 VALERIA. My ladies both, good day to you.

 VOLUMNIA. Sweet madam!

 VIRGILIA. I am glad to see your ladyship.

 VALERIA. How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little son?

 VIRGILIA. I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

 VOLUMNIA. He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster.

 VALERIA. O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how 'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he mammock'd it!

 VOLUMNIA. One on's father's moods.

 VALERIA. Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

 VIRGILIA. A crack, madam.

 VALERIA. Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.

 VIRGILIA. No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

 VALERIA. Not out of doors!

 VOLUMNIA. She shall, she shall.

 VIRGILIA. Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.

 VALERIA. Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

 VIRGILIA. I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

 VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you?

 VIRGILIA. 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

 VALERIA. You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us. VIRGILIA. No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth. VALERIA. In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.

 VIRGILIA. O, good madam, there can be none yet.

 VALERIA. Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last night.

 VIRGILIA. Indeed, madam?

 VALERIA. In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.

 VIRGILIA. Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything hereafter.

 VOLUMNIA. Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.

 VALERIA. In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o' door and go along with us.

 VIRGILIA. No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much mirth.

 VALERIA. Well then, farewell. Exeunt

 SCENE IV.

 Before Corioli

 Enter MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with drum and colours,

 with CAPTAINS and soldiers. To them a MESSENGER

 MARCIUS. Yonder comes news; a wager- they have met.

 LARTIUS. My horse to yours- no.

 MARCIUS. 'Tis done.

 LARTIUS. Agreed.

 MARCIUS. Say, has our general met the enemy?

 MESSENGER. They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.

 LARTIUS. So, the good horse is mine.

 MARCIUS. I'll buy him of you.

 LARTIUS. No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

 MARCIUS. How far off lie these armies?

 MESSENGER. Within this mile and half.

 MARCIUS. Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.

 Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,

 That we with smoking swords may march from hence

 To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.

 They sound a parley. Enter two SENATORS with others,

 on the walls of Corioli

 Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

 FIRST SENATOR. No, nor a man that fears you less than he: That's lesser than a little. [Drum afar off] Hark, our drums Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls

 Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,

 Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;

 They'll open of themselves. [Alarum far off] Hark you far off! There is Aufidius. List what work he makes

 Amongst your cloven army.

 MARCIUS. O, they are at it!

 LARTIUS. Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

 Enter the army of the Volsces

 MARCIUS. They fear us not, but issue forth their city.

 Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight

 With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus. They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,

 Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows.

 He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,

 And he shall feel mine edge.

 Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.

 Re-enter MARCIUS, cursing

 MARCIUS. All the contagion of the south light on you,

 You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues

 Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd

 Farther than seen, and one infect another

 Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese

 That bear the shapes of men, how have you run

 From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!

 All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale

 With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,

 Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe

 And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;

 If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,

 As they us to our trenches. Follow me.

 Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows

 them to the gates

 So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;

 'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,

 Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.

 [MARCIUS enters the gates]

 FIRST SOLDIER. Fool-hardiness; not I.

 SECOND SOLDIER. Not I. [MARCIUS is shut in] FIRST SOLDIER. See, they have shut him in.

 ALL. To th' pot, I warrant him. [Alarum continues]

 Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS

 LARTIUS. What is become of Marcius?

 ALL. Slain, sir, doubtless.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Following the fliers at the very heels,

 With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,

 Clapp'd to their gates. He is himself alone,

 To answer all the city.

 LARTIUS. O noble fellow!

 Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,

 And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;

 A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,

 Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier

 Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible

 Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and

 The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds

 Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world

 Were feverous and did tremble.

 Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy

 FIRST SOLDIER. Look, sir.

 LARTIUS. O, 'tis Marcius!

 Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

 [They fight, and all enter the city]

 SCENE V.

 Within Corioli. A street

 Enter certain Romans, with spoils

 FIRST ROMAN. This will I carry to Rome.

 SECOND ROMAN. And I this.

 THIRD ROMAN. A murrain on 't! I took this for silver.

 [Alarum continues still afar off]

 Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS With a trumpeter

 MARCIUS. See here these movers that do prize their hours

 At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,

 Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would

 Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,

 Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!

 Exeunt pillagers And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!

 There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,

 Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take

 Convenient numbers to make good the city;

 Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste

 To help Cominius.

 LARTIUS. Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;

 Thy exercise hath been too violent

 For a second course of fight.

 MARCIUS. Sir, praise me not;

 My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well;

 The blood I drop is rather physical

 Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus

 I will appear, and fight.

 LARTIUS. Now the fair goddess, Fortune,

 Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms

 Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,

 Prosperity be thy page!

 MARCIUS. Thy friend no less

 Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.

 LARTIUS. Thou worthiest Marcius! Exit MARCIUS Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;

 Call thither all the officers o' th' town,

 Where they shall know our mind. Away! Exeunt

 SCENE VI.

 Near the camp of COMINIUS

 Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers

 COMINIUS. Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands

 Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,

 We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,

 By interims and conveying gusts we have heard

 The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,

 Lead their successes as we wish our own,

 That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring, May give you thankful sacrifice!

 Enter A MESSENGER

 Thy news?

 MESSENGER. The citizens of Corioli have issued

 And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;

 I saw our party to their trenches driven,

 And then I came away.

 COMINIUS. Though thou speak'st truth,

 Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?

 MESSENGER. Above an hour, my lord.

 COMINIUS. 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.

 How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,

 And bring thy news so late?

 MESSENGER. Spies of the Volsces

 Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel

 Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,

 Half an hour since brought my report.

 Enter MARCIUS

 COMINIUS. Who's yonder

 That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!

 He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have

 Before-time seen him thus.

 MARCIUS. Come I too late?

 COMINIUS. The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor

 More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue

 From every meaner man.

 MARCIUS. Come I too late?

 COMINIUS. Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,

 But mantled in your own.

 MARCIUS. O! let me clip ye

 In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart

 As merry as when our nuptial day was done,

 And tapers burn'd to bedward.

 COMINIUS. Flower of warriors,

 How is't with Titus Lartius?

 MARCIUS. As with a man busied about decrees:

 Condemning some to death and some to exile;

 Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;

 Holding Corioli in the name of Rome

 Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,

 To let him slip at will.

 COMINIUS. Where is that slave

 Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?

 Where is he? Call him hither.

 MARCIUS. Let him alone;

 He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,

 The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!

 The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge

 From rascals worse than they.

 COMINIUS. But how prevail'd you?

 MARCIUS. Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.

 Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?

 If not, why cease you till you are so?

 COMINIUS. Marcius,

 We have at disadvantage fought, and did

 Retire to win our purpose.

 MARCIUS. How lies their battle? Know you on which side

 They have plac'd their men of trust?

 COMINIUS. As I guess, Marcius,

 Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,

 Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,

 Their very heart of hope.

 MARCIUS. I do beseech you,

 By all the battles wherein we have fought,

 By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows

 We have made to endure friends, that you directly

 Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;

 And that you not delay the present, but,

 Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,

 We prove this very hour.

 COMINIUS. Though I could wish

 You were conducted to a gentle bath

 And balms applied to you, yet dare I never

 Deny your asking: take your choice of those

 That best can aid your action.

 MARCIUS. Those are they

 That most are willing. If any such be hereAs

 it were sin to doubt- that love this painting

 Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear

 Lesser his person than an ill report;

 If any think brave death outweighs bad life

 And that his country's dearer than himself;

 Let him alone, or so many so minded,

 Wave thus to express his disposition,

 And follow Marcius. [They all shout and wave their

 swords, take him up in their arms and cast up their caps] O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?

 If these shows be not outward, which of you

 But is four Volsces? None of you but is

 Able to bear against the great Aufidius

 A shield as hard as his. A certain number,

 Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest

 Shall bear the business in some other fight,

 As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;

 And four shall quickly draw out my command,

 Which men are best inclin'd.

 COMINIUS. March on, my fellows;

 Make good this ostentation, and you shall

 Divide in all with us. Exeunt

 SCENE VII.

 The gates of Corioli

 TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with a LIEUTENANT, other soldiers, and a scout

 LARTIUS. So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties

 As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch

 Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve

 For a short holding. If we lose the field

 We cannot keep the town.

 LIEUTENANT. Fear not our care, sir.

 LARTIUS. Hence, and shut your gates upon's.

 Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us. Exeunt

 SCENE VIII.

 A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps

 Alarum, as in battle. Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at several doors

 MARCIUS. I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee Worse than a promise-breaker.

 AUFIDIUS. We hate alike:

 Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor

 More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

 MARCIUS. Let the first budger die the other's slave,

 And the gods doom him after!

 AUFIDIUS. If I fly, Marcius,

 Halloa me like a hare.

 MARCIUS. Within these three hours, Tullus,

 Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,

 And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood

 Wherein thou seest me mask'd. For thy revenge

 Wrench up thy power to th' highest.

 AUFIDIUS. Wert thou the Hector

 That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,

 Thou shouldst not scape me here.

 Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in

 breathless

 Officious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me

 In your condemned seconds. Exeunt

 SCENE IX.

 The Roman camp

 Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Enter, at one door, COMINIUS with the Romans; at another door, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf

 COMINIUS. If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work, Thou't not believe thy deeds; but I'll report it

 Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;

 Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,

 I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted

 And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes, That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,

 Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods

 Our Rome hath such a soldier.'

 Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast,

 Having fully din'd before.

 Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit

 LARTIUS. O General,

 Here is the steed, we the caparison.

 Hadst thou beheldMARCIUS.

 Pray now, no more; my mother,

 Who has a charter to extol her blood,

 When she does praise me grieves me. I have done

 As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd

 As you have been- that's for my country.

 He that has but effected his good will

 Hath overta'en mine act.

 COMINIUS. You shall not be

 The grave of your deserving; Rome must know

 The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment

 Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,

 To hide your doings and to silence that

 Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,

 Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you,

 In sign of what you are, not to reward

 What you have done, before our army hear me.

 MARCIUS. I have some wounds upon me, and they smart

 To hear themselves rememb'red.

 COMINIUS. Should they not,

 Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude

 And tent themselves with death. Of all the horsesWhereof

 we have ta'en good, and good store- of all

 The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,

 We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth

 Before the common distribution at

 Your only choice.

 MARCIUS. I thank you, General,

 But cannot make my heart consent to take

 A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,

 And stand upon my common part with those

 That have beheld the doing.

 A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!' cast up their caps and lances. COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare

 May these same instruments which you profane

 Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall

 I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be Made all of false-fac'd soothing. When steel grows

 Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made

 An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.

 For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled,

 Or foil'd some debile wretch, which without note

 Here's many else have done, you shout me forth

 In acclamations hyperbolical,

 As if I lov'd my little should be dieted

 In praises sauc'd with lies.

 COMINIUS. Too modest are you;

 More cruel to your good report than grateful

 To us that give you truly. By your patience,

 If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put youLike

 one that means his proper harm- in manacles,

 Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,

 As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius

 Wears this war's garland; in token of the which,

 My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,

 With all his trim belonging; and from this time,

 For what he did before Corioli, can him

 With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,

 Caius Marcius Coriolanus.

 Bear th' addition nobly ever!

 [Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums] ALL. Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

 CORIOLANUS. I will go wash;

 And when my face is fair you shall perceive

 Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you;

 I mean to stride your steed, and at all times

 To undercrest your good addition

 To th' fairness of my power.

 COMINIUS. So, to our tent;

 Where, ere we do repose us, we will write

 To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,

 Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome

 The best, with whom we may articulate

 For their own good and ours.

 LARTIUS. I shall, my lord.

 CORIOLANUS. The gods begin to mock me. I, that now

 Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg

 Of my Lord General.

 COMINIUS. Take't- 'tis yours; what is't?

 CORIOLANUS. I sometime lay here in Corioli

 At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.

 He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;

 But then Aufidius was within my view,

 And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you

 To give my poor host freedom.

 COMINIUS. O, well begg'd!

 Were he the butcher of my son, he should

 Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

 LARTIUS. Marcius, his name?

 CORIOLANUS. By Jupiter, forgot!

 I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.

 Have we no wine here?

 COMINIUS. Go we to our tent.

 The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time

 It should be look'd to. Come. Exeunt

 SCENE X.

 The camp of the Volsces

 A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers

 AUFIDIUS. The town is ta'en.

 FIRST SOLDIER. 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition. AUFIDIUS. Condition!

 I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,

 Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?

 What good condition can a treaty find

 I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,

 I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;

 And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter

 As often as we eat. By th' elements,

 If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,

 He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation

 Hath not that honour in't it had; for where

 I thought to crush him in an equal force,

 True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,

 Or wrath or craft may get him.

 FIRST SOLDIER. He's the devil.

 AUFIDIUS. Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd With only suff'ring stain by him; for him

 Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,

 Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,

 The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,

 Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up

 Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst

 My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it

 At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,

 Against the hospitable canon, would I

 Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city;

 Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must

 Be hostages for Rome.

 FIRST SOLDIER. Will not you go?

 AUFIDIUS. I am attended at the cypress grove; I pray you- 'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither

 How the world goes, that to the pace of it

 I may spur on my journey.

 FIRST SOLDIER. I shall, sir. Exeunt

 ACT II. SCENE I.

 Rome. A public place

 Enter MENENIUS, with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS

 MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight. BRUTUS. Good or bad?

 MENENIUS. Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Marcius.

 SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

 MENENIUS. Pray you, who does the wolf love?

 SICINIUS. The lamb.

 MENENIUS. Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius.

 BRUTUS. He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

 MENENIUS. He's a bear indeed, that lives fike a lamb. You two are old men; tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

 BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, sir.

 MENENIUS. In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance?

 BRUTUS. He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.

 SICINIUS. Especially in pride.

 BRUTUS. And topping all others in boasting.

 MENENIUS. This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured here in the city- I mean of us o' th' right-hand file? Do you? BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censur'd?

 MENENIUS. Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry? BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, well, sir, well.

 MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for being proud?

 BRUTUS. We do it not alone, sir.

 MENENIUS. I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O that you could!

 BOTH TRIBUNES. What then, sir?

 MENENIUS. Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome. SICINIUS. Menenius, you are known well enough too.

 MENENIUS. I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have deliver'd the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be known well enough too?

 BRUTUS. Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

 MENENIUS. You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.

 BRUTUS. Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.

 MENENIUS. Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion; though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.

 [BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]

 Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA

 How now, my as fair as noble ladies- and the moon, were she earthly, no nobler- whither do you follow your eyes so fast? VOLUMNIA. Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the love of Juno, let's go.

 MENENIUS. Ha! Marcius coming home?

 VOLUMNIA. Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous

 approbation.

 MENENIUS. Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!

 Marcius coming home!

 VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA. Nay, 'tis true.

 VOLUMNIA. Look, here's a letter from him; the state hath another, his wife another; and I think there's one at home for you. MENENIUS. I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me? VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't. MENENIUS. A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years' health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.

 VIRGILIA. O, no, no, no.

 VOLUMNIA. O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.

 MENENIUS. So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings a victory in his pocket? The wounds become him.

 VOLUMNIA. On's brows, Menenius, he comes the third time home with the oaken garland.

 MENENIUS. Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?

 VOLUMNIA. Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.

 MENENIUS. And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he had stay'd by him, I would not have been so fidius'd for all the chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate possess'd of this?

 VOLUMNIA. Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war; he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.

 VALERIA. In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

 MENENIUS. Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.

 VIRGILIA. The gods grant them true!

 VOLUMNIA. True! pow, waw.

 MENENIUS. True! I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? [To the TRIBUNES] God save your good worships! Marcius is coming home; he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded? VOLUMNIA. I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm; there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place. He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' body. MENENIUS. One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I know.

 VOLUMNIA. He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds upon him.

 MENENIUS. Now it's twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy's grave. [A shout and flourish] Hark! the trumpets.

 VOLUMNIA. These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he carries

 noise, and behind him he leaves tears;

 Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie,

 Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die.

 

              A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the

                GENERAL, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them,

             CORIOLANUS, crown'd with an oaken garland; with

                     CAPTAINS and soldiers and a HERALD

  

 

 HERALD. Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight

 Within Corioli gates, where he hath won,

 With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these

 In honour follows Coriolanus.

 Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! [Flourish] ALL. Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

 CORIOLANUS. No more of this, it does offend my heart.

 Pray now, no more.

 COMINIUS. Look, sir, your mother!

 CORIOLANUS. O,

 You have, I know, petition'd all the gods

 For my prosperity! [Kneels] VOLUMNIA. Nay, my good soldier, up;

 My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and

 By deed-achieving honour newly nam'dWhat

 is it? Coriolanus must I can thee?

 But, O, thy wife!

 CORIOLANUS. My gracious silence, hail!

 Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,

 That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,

 Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,

 And mothers that lack sons.

 MENENIUS. Now the gods crown thee!

 CORIOLANUS. And live you yet? [To VALERIA] O my sweet lady, pardon.

 VOLUMNIA. I know not where to turn.

 O, welcome home! And welcome, General.

 And y'are welcome all.

 MENENIUS. A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep

 And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome!

 A curse begin at very root on's heart

 That is not glad to see thee! You are three

 That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,

 We have some old crab trees here at home that will not

 Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.

 We call a nettle but a nettle, and

 The faults of fools but folly.

 COMINIUS. Ever right.

 CORIOLANUS. Menenius ever, ever.

 HERALD. Give way there, and go on.

 CORIOLANUS. [To his wife and mother] Your hand, and yours. Ere in our own house I do shade my head,

 The good patricians must be visited;

 From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings,

 But with them change of honours.

 VOLUMNIA. I have lived

 To see inherited my very wishes,

 And the buildings of my fancy; only

 There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but

 Our Rome will cast upon thee.

 CORIOLANUS. Know, good mother,

 I had rather be their servant in my way

 Than sway with them in theirs.

 COMINIUS. On, to the Capitol.

 [Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before]

 BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward

 BRUTUS. All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights

 Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse

 Into a rapture lets her baby cry

 While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins

 Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,

 Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows, Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd

 With variable complexions, all agreeing

 In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens

 Do press among the popular throngs and puff

 To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames

 Commit the war of white and damask in

 Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil

 Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,

 As if that whatsoever god who leads him

 Were slily crept into his human powers,

 And gave him graceful posture.

 SICINIUS. On the sudden

 I warrant him consul.

 BRUTUS. Then our office may

 During his power go sleep.

 SICINIUS. He cannot temp'rately transport his honours

 From where he should begin and end, but will

 Lose those he hath won.

 BRUTUS. In that there's comfort.

 SICINIUS. Doubt not

 The commoners, for whom we stand, but they

 Upon their ancient malice will forget

 With the least cause these his new honours; which

 That he will give them make I as little question

 As he is proud to do't.

 BRUTUS. I heard him swear,

 Were he to stand for consul, never would he

 Appear i' th' market-place, nor on him put

 The napless vesture of humility;

 Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds

 To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.

 SICINIUS. 'Tis right.

 BRUTUS. It was his word. O, he would miss it rather

 Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him

 And the desire of the nobles.

 SICINIUS. I wish no better

 Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it

 In execution.

 BRUTUS. 'Tis most like he will.

 SICINIUS. It shall be to him then as our good wills:

 A sure destruction.

 BRUTUS. So it must fall out

 To him or our authorities. For an end,

 We must suggest the people in what hatred

 He still hath held them; that to's power he would

 Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and

 Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them

 In human action and capacity

 Of no more soul nor fitness for the world

 Than camels in their war, who have their provand

 Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows

 For sinking under them.

 SICINIUS. This, as you say, suggested

 At some time when his soaring insolence

 Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,

 If he be put upon't, and that's as easy

 As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire

 To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze

 Shall darken him for ever.

 Enter A MESSENGER

 BRUTUS. What's the matter?

 MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought

 That Marcius shall be consul.

 I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and

 The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,

 Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,

 Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended

 As to Jove's statue, and the commons made

 A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.

 I never saw the like.

 BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol,

 And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,

 But hearts for the event.

 SICINIUS. Have with you. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Rome. The Capitol

 Enter two OFFICERS, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol

 FIRST OFFICER. Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for consulships?

 SECOND OFFICER. Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it.

 FIRST OFFICER. That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common people.

 SECOND OFFICER. Faith, there have been many great men that have flatter'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their

 disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't.

 FIRST OFFICER. If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to flatter them for their love.

 SECOND OFFICER. He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every car that heard it.

 FIRST OFFICER. No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they are coming.

 A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES

 OF THE PEOPLE, LICTORS before them; CORIOLANUS,

 

              MENENIUS, COMINIUS the Consul. SICINIUS and

                 BRUTUS take their places by themselves.

                           CORIOLANUS stands

  

 

 MENENIUS. Having determin'd of the Volsces, and

 To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,

 As the main point of this our after-meeting,

 To gratify his noble service that

 Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,

 Most reverend and grave elders, to desire

 The present consul and last general

 In our well-found successes to report

 A little of that worthy work perform'd

 By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom

 We met here both to thank and to remember

 With honours like himself. [CORIOLANUS sits] FIRST SENATOR. Speak, good Cominius.

 Leave nothing out for length, and make us think

 Rather our state's defective for requital

 Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' people,

 We do request your kindest ears; and, after,

 Your loving motion toward the common body,

 To yield what passes here.

 SICINIUS. We are convented

 Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts

 Inclinable to honour and advance

 The theme of our assembly.

 BRUTUS. Which the rather

 We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember

 A kinder value of the people than

 He hath hereto priz'd them at.

 MENENIUS. That's off, that's off;

 I would you rather had been silent. Please you

 To hear Cominius speak?

 BRUTUS. Most willingly.

 But yet my caution was more pertinent

 Than the rebuke you give it.

 MENENIUS. He loves your people;

 But tie him not to be their bedfellow.

 Worthy Cominius, speak.

 [CORIOLANUS rises, and offers to go away] Nay, keep your place.

 FIRST SENATOR. Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear

 What you have nobly done.

 CORIOLANUS. Your Honours' pardon.

 I had rather have my wounds to heal again

 Than hear say how I got them.

 BRUTUS. Sir, I hope

 My words disbench'd you not.

 CORIOLANUS. No, sir; yet oft,

 When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.

 You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not. But your people,

 I love them as they weighMENENIUS.

 Pray now, sit down.

 CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit

 To hear my nothings monster'd. Exit MENENIUS. Masters of the people,

 Your multiplying spawn how can he flatterThat'

 s thousand to one good one- when you now see

 He had rather venture all his limbs for honour

 Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

 COMINIUS. I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus

 Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held

 That valour is the chiefest virtue and

 Most dignifies the haver. If it be,

 The man I speak of cannot in the world

 Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,

 When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought

 Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,

 Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight

 When with his Amazonian chin he drove

 The bristled lips before him; he bestrid

 An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view

 Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,

 And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,

 When he might act the woman in the scene,

 He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed

 Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age

 Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,

 And in the brunt of seventeen battles since

 He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,

 Before and in Corioli, let me say

 I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers,

 And by his rare example made the coward

 Turn terror into sport; as weeds before

 A vessel under sail, so men obey'd

 And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,

 Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot

 He was a thing of blood, whose every motion

 Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red

 The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted

 With shunless destiny; aidless came off,

 And with a sudden re-enforcement struck

 Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.

 When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce

 His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit

 Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,

 And to the battle came he; where he did

 Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if

 'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd

 Both field and city ours he never stood

 To ease his breast with panting.

 MENENIUS. Worthy man!

 FIRST SENATOR. He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him.

 COMINIUS. Our spoils he kick'd at,

 And look'd upon things precious as they were

 The common muck of the world. He covets less

 Than misery itself would give, rewards

 His deeds with doing them, and is content

 To spend the time to end it.

 MENENIUS. He's right noble;

 Let him be call'd for.

 FIRST SENATOR. Call Coriolanus.

 OFFICER. He doth appear.

 Re-enter CORIOLANUS

 MENENIUS. The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd

 To make thee consul.

 CORIOLANUS. I do owe them still

 My life and services.

 MENENIUS. It then remains

 That you do speak to the people.

 CORIOLANUS. I do beseech you

 Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot

 Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them

 For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you

 That I may pass this doing.

 SICINIUS. Sir, the people

 Must have their voices; neither will they bate

 One jot of ceremony.

 MENENIUS. Put them not to't.

 Pray you go fit you to the custom, and

 Take to you, as your predecessors have,

 Your honour with your form.

 CORIOLANUS. It is a part

 That I shall blush in acting, and might well

 Be taken from the people.

 BRUTUS. Mark you that?

 CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'

 Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide,

 As if I had receiv'd them for the hire

 Of their breath only!

 MENENIUS. Do not stand upon't.

 We recommend to you, Tribunes of the People,

 Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul

 Wish we all joy and honour.

 SENATORS. To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!

 

                               [Flourish. Cornets. Then exeunt all

                                          but SICINIUS and BRUTUS]

  

 

 BRUTUS. You see how he intends to use the people.

 SICINIUS. May they perceive's intent! He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested

 Should be in them to give.

 BRUTUS. Come, we'll inform them

 Of our proceedings here. On th' market-place

 I know they do attend us. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Rome. The Forum

 Enter seven or eight citizens

 FIRST CITIZEN. Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.

 SECOND CITIZEN. We may, sir, if we will.

 THIRD CITIZEN. We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.

 FIRST CITIZEN. And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.

 THIRD CITIZEN. We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' th' compass.

 SECOND CITIZEN. Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly?

 THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at liberty 'twould sure southward.

 SECOND CITIZEN. Why that way?

 THIRD CITIZEN. To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.

 SECOND CITIZEN. YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you may.

 THIRD CITIZEN. Are you all resolv'd to give your voices? But that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I say, if he would incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.

 

                  Enter CORIOLANUS, in a gown of humility,

                                 with MENENIUS

  

 

 Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour. We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues; therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him. ALL. Content, content. Exeunt citizens MENENIUS. O sir, you are not right; have you not known

 The worthiest men have done't?

 CORIOLANUS. What must I say?

 'I pray, sir'- Plague upon't! I cannot bring

 My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds

 I got them in my country's service, when

 Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran

 From th' noise of our own drums.'

 MENENIUS. O me, the gods!

 You must not speak of that. You must desire them

 To think upon you.

 CORIOLANUS. Think upon me? Hang 'em!

 I would they would forget me, like the virtues

 Which our divines lose by 'em.

 MENENIUS. You'll mar all.

 I'll leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you,

 In wholesome manner. Exit

 Re-enter three of the citizens

 CORIOLANUS. Bid them wash their faces

 And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.

 You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.

 THIRD CITIZEN. We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't. CORIOLANUS. Mine own desert.

 SECOND CITIZEN. Your own desert?

 CORIOLANUS. Ay, not mine own desire.

 THIRD CITIZEN. How, not your own desire?

 CORIOLANUS. No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.

 THIRD CITIZEN. YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.

 CORIOLANUS. Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship? FIRST CITIZEN. The price is to ask it kindly.

 CORIOLANUS. Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what say you?

 SECOND CITIZEN. You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

 CORIOLANUS. A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd. I have your alms. Adieu.

 THIRD CITIZEN. But this is something odd.

 SECOND CITIZEN. An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter.

 Exeunt the three citizens

 Re-enter two other citizens

 CORIOLANUS. Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown. FOURTH CITIZEN. You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.

 CORIOLANUS. Your enigma?

 FOURTH CITIZEN. You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common people.

 CORIOLANUS. You should account me the more virtuous, that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you I may be consul.

 FIFTH CITIZEN. We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give you our voices heartily.

 FOURTH CITIZEN. You have received many wounds for your country. CORIOLANUS. I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther. BOTH CITIZENS. The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

 Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS. Most sweet voices!

 Better it is to die, better to starve,

 Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.

 Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here

 To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear

 Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.

 What custom wills, in all things should we do't,

 The dust on antique time would lie unswept,

 And mountainous error be too highly heap'd

 For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,

 Let the high office and the honour go

 To one that would do thus. I am half through:

 The one part suffered, the other will I do.

 Re-enter three citizens more

 Here come moe voices.

 Your voices. For your voices I have fought;

 Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear

 Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six

 I have seen and heard of; for your voices have

 Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices?

 Indeed, I would be consul.

 SIXTH CITIZEN. He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice.

 SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people!

 ALL. Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

 Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS. Worthy voices!

 Re-enter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS

 MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes Endue you with the people's voice. Remains

 That, in th' official marks invested, you

 Anon do meet the Senate.

 CORIOLANUS. Is this done?

 SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharg'd.

 The people do admit you, and are summon'd

 To meet anon, upon your approbation.

 CORIOLANUS. Where? At the Senate House?

 SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus.

 CORIOLANUS. May I change these garments?

 SICINIUS. You may, sir.

 CORIOLANUS. That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again, Repair to th' Senate House.

 MENENIUS. I'll keep you company. Will you along?

 BRUTUS. We stay here for the people.

 SICINIUS. Fare you well.

 Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS He has it now; and by his looks methinks

 'Tis warm at's heart.

 BRUTUS. With a proud heart he wore

 His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?

 Re-enter citizens

 SICINIUS. How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?

 FIRST CITIZEN. He has our voices, sir.

 BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

 SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,

 He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

 THIRD CITIZEN. Certainly;

 He flouted us downright.

 FIRST CITIZEN. No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us. SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says He us'd us scornfully. He should have show'd us

 His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.

 SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure.

 ALL. No, no; no man saw 'em.

 THIRD CITIZEN. He said he had wounds which he could show in

 private,

 And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,

 'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom

 But by your voices will not so permit me;

 Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,

 Here was 'I thank you for your voices. Thank you,

 Your most sweet voices. Now you have left your voices,

 I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

 SICINIUS. Why either were you ignorant to see't,

 Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness

 To yield your voices?

 BRUTUS. Could you not have told himAs

 you were lesson'd- when he had no power

 But was a petty servant to the state,

 He was your enemy; ever spake against

 Your liberties and the charters that you bear

 I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving

 A place of potency and sway o' th' state,

 If he should still malignantly remain

 Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might

 Be curses to yourselves? You should have said

 That as his worthy deeds did claim no less

 Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature

 Would think upon you for your voices, and

 Translate his malice towards you into love,

 Standing your friendly lord.

 SICINIUS. Thus to have said,

 As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit

 And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd

 Either his gracious promise, which you might,

 As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;

 Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,

 Which easily endures not article

 Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,

 You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler

 And pass'd him unelected.

 BRUTUS. Did you perceive

 He did solicit you in free contempt

 When he did need your loves; and do you think

 That his contempt shall not be bruising to you

 When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies

 No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry

 Against the rectorship of judgment?

 SICINIUS. Have you

 Ere now denied the asker, and now again,

 Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow

 Your su'd-for tongues?

 THIRD CITIZEN. He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.

 SECOND CITIZENS. And will deny him;

 I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

 FIRST CITIZEN. I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece 'em.

 BRUTUS. Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends

 They have chose a consul that will from them take

 Their liberties, make them of no more voice

 Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking

 As therefore kept to do so.

 SICINIUS. Let them assemble;

 And, on a safer judgment, all revoke

 Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride

 And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not

 With what contempt he wore the humble weed;

 How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,

 Thinking upon his services, took from you

 Th' apprehension of his present portance,

 Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion

 After the inveterate hate he bears you.

 BRUTUS. Lay

 A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,

 No impediment between, but that you must

 Cast your election on him.

 SICINIUS. Say you chose him

 More after our commandment than as guided

 By your own true affections; and that your minds,

 Pre-occupied with what you rather must do

 Than what you should, made you against the grain

 To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.

 BRUTUS. Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,

 How youngly he began to serve his country,

 How long continued; and what stock he springs ofThe

 noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came

 That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,

 Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;

 Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,

 That our best water brought by conduits hither;

 And Censorinus, nobly named so,

 Twice being by the people chosen censor,

 Was his great ancestor.

 SICINIUS. One thus descended,

 That hath beside well in his person wrought

 To be set high in place, we did commend

 To your remembrances; but you have found,

 Scaling his present bearing with his past,

 That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke

 Your sudden approbation.

 BRUTUS. Say you ne'er had done'tHarp

 on that still- but by our putting on;

 And presently, when you have drawn your number,

 Repair to th' Capitol.

 CITIZENS. will will so; almost all

 Repent in their election. Exeunt plebeians BRUTUS. Let them go on;

 This mutiny were better put in hazard

 Than stay, past doubt, for greater.

 If, as his nature is, he fall in rage

 With their refusal, both observe and answer

 The vantage of his anger.

 SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come.

 We will be there before the stream o' th' people;

 And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,

 Which we have goaded onward. Exeunt

 ACT III. SCENE I.

 Rome. A street

 Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the GENTRY, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other SENATORS

 CORIOLANUS. Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?

 LARTIUS. He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd

 Our swifter composition.

 CORIOLANUS. So then the Volsces stand but as at first,

 Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road

 Upon's again.

 COMINIUS. They are worn, Lord Consul, so

 That we shall hardly in our ages see

 Their banners wave again.

 CORIOLANUS. Saw you Aufidius?

 LARTIUS. On safeguard he came to me, and did curse

 Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely

 Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.

 CORIOLANUS. Spoke he of me?

 LARTIUS. He did, my lord.

 CORIOLANUS. How? What?

 LARTIUS. How often he had met you, sword to sword;

 That of all things upon the earth he hated

 Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes

 To hopeless restitution, so he might

 Be call'd your vanquisher.

 CORIOLANUS. At Antium lives he?

 LARTIUS. At Antium.

 CORIOLANUS. I wish I had a cause to seek him there,

 To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.

 Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

 Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,

 The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,

 For they do prank them in authority,

 Against all noble sufferance.

 SICINIUS. Pass no further.

 CORIOLANUS. Ha! What is that?

 BRUTUS. It will be dangerous to go on- no further.

 CORIOLANUS. What makes this change?

 MENENIUS. The matter?

 COMINIUS. Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

 BRUTUS. Cominius, no.

 CORIOLANUS. Have I had children's voices?

 FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place. BRUTUS. The people are incens'd against him.

 SICINIUS. Stop,

 Or all will fall in broil.

 CORIOLANUS. Are these your herd?

 Must these have voices, that can yield them now

 And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices? You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?

 Have you not set them on?

 MENENIUS. Be calm, be calm.

 CORIOLANUS. It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,

 To curb the will of the nobility;

 Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule

 Nor ever will be rul'd.

 BRUTUS. Call't not a plot.

 The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,

 When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;

 Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them

 Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

 CORIOLANUS. Why, this was known before.

 BRUTUS. Not to them all.

 CORIOLANUS. Have you inform'd them sithence?

 BRUTUS. How? I inform them!

 COMINIUS. You are like to do such business.

 BRUTUS. Not unlike

 Each way to better yours.

 CORIOLANUS. Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,

 Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me

 Your fellow tribune.

 SICINIUS. You show too much of that

 For which the people stir; if you will pass

 To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,

 Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,

 Or never be so noble as a consul,

 Nor yoke with him for tribune.

 MENENIUS. Let's be calm.

 COMINIUS. The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring

 Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus

 Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely

 I' th' plain way of his merit.

 CORIOLANUS. Tell me of corn!

 This was my speech, and I will speak't againMENENIUS.

 Not now, not now.

 FIRST SENATOR. Not in this heat, sir, now.

 CORIOLANUS. Now, as I live, I will.

 My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.

 For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them

 Regard me as I do not flatter, and

 Therein behold themselves. I say again,

 In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate

 The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,

 Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd, By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,

 Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that

 Which they have given to beggars.

 MENENIUS. Well, no more.

 FIRST SENATOR. No more words, we beseech you.

 CORIOLANUS. How? no more!

 As for my country I have shed my blood,

 Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs

 Coin words till their decay against those measles

 Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought

 The very way to catch them.

 BRUTUS. You speak o' th' people

 As if you were a god, to punish; not

 A man of their infirmity.

 SICINIUS. 'Twere well

 We let the people know't.

 MENENIUS. What, what? his choler?

 CORIOLANUS. Choler!

 Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,

 By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

 SICINIUS. It is a mind

 That shall remain a poison where it is,

 Not poison any further.

 CORIOLANUS. Shall remain!

 Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you

 His absolute 'shall'?

 COMINIUS. 'Twas from the canon.

 CORIOLANUS. 'Shall'!

 O good but most unwise patricians! Why,

 You grave but reckless senators, have you thus

 Given Hydra here to choose an officer

 That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but

 The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit

 To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,

 And make your channel his? If he have power,

 Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake

 Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,

 Be not as common fools; if you are not,

 Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,

 If they be senators; and they are no less,

 When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste

 Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;

 And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'

 His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench

 Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,

 It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches

 To know, when two authorities are up,

 Neither supreme, how soon confusion

 May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take

 The one by th' other.

 COMINIUS. Well, on to th' market-place.

 CORIOLANUS. Whoever gave that counsel to give forth

 The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd

 Sometime in GreeceMENENIUS.

 Well, well, no more of that.

 CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had more absolute pow'rI say they nourish'd disobedience, fed

 The ruin of the state.

 BRUTUS. Why shall the people give

 One that speaks thus their voice?

 CORIOLANUS. I'll give my reasons,

 More worthier than their voices. They know the corn

 Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd

 They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war

 Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,

 They would not thread the gates. This kind of service

 Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war,

 Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd

 Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation

 Which they have often made against the Senate,

 All cause unborn, could never be the native

 Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?

 How shall this bosom multiplied digest

 The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express

 What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;

 We are the greater poll, and in true fear

 They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase

 The nature of our seats, and make the rabble

 Call our cares fears; which will in time

 Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in

 The crows to peck the eagles.

 MENENIUS. Come, enough.

 BRUTUS. Enough, with over measure.

 CORIOLANUS. No, take more.

 What may be sworn by, both divine and human,

 Seal what I end withal! This double worship,

 Where one part does disdain with cause, the other

 Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom, Cannot conclude but by the yea and no

 Of general ignorance- it must omit

 Real necessities, and give way the while

 To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows

 Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech youYou

 that will be less fearful than discreet;

 That love the fundamental part of state

 More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer

 A noble life before a long, and wish

 To jump a body with a dangerous physic

 That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out

 The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick

 The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour

 Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state

 Of that integrity which should become't,

 Not having the power to do the good it would,

 For th' ill which doth control't.

 BRUTUS. Has said enough.

 SICINIUS. Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer

 As traitors do.

 CORIOLANUS. Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!

 What should the people do with these bald tribunes,

 On whom depending, their obedience fails

 To the greater bench? In a rebellion,

 When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,

 Then were they chosen; in a better hour

 Let what is meet be said it must be meet,

 And throw their power i' th' dust.

 BRUTUS. Manifest treason!

 SICINIUS. This a consul? No.

 BRUTUS. The aediles, ho!

 Enter an AEDILE

 Let him be apprehended.

 SICINIUS. Go call the people, [Exit AEDILE] in whose name myself Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,

 A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,

 And follow to thine answer.

 CORIOLANUS. Hence, old goat!

 PATRICIANS. We'll surety him.

 COMINIUS. Ag'd sir, hands off.

 CORIOLANUS. Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones Out of thy garments.

 SICINIUS. Help, ye citizens!

 Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES

 MENENIUS. On both sides more respect.

 SICINIUS. Here's he that would take from you all your power. BRUTUS. Seize him, aediles.

 PLEBEIANS. Down with him! down with him!

 SECOND SENATOR. Weapons, weapons, weapons!

 [They all bustle about CORIOLANUS] ALL. Tribunes! patricians! citizens! What, ho! Sicinius!

 Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!

 PATRICIANS. Peace, peace, peace; stay, hold, peace!

 MENENIUS. What is about to be? I am out of breath;

 Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You tribunes

 To th' people- Coriolanus, patience!

 Speak, good Sicinius.

 SICINIUS. Hear me, people; peace!

 PLEBEIANS. Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak. SICINIUS. You are at point to lose your liberties.

 Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,

 Whom late you have nam'd for consul.

 MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!

 This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

 FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.

 SICINIUS. What is the city but the people?

 PLEBEIANS. True,

 The people are the city.

 BRUTUS. By the consent of all we were establish'd

 The people's magistrates.

 PLEBEIANS. You so remain.

 MENENIUS. And so are like to do.

 COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat,

 To bring the roof to the foundation,

 And bury all which yet distinctly ranges

 In heaps and piles of ruin.

 SICINIUS. This deserves death.

 BRUTUS. Or let us stand to our authority

 Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,

 Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power

 We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy

 Of present death.

 SICINIUS. Therefore lay hold of him;

 Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence

 Into destruction cast him.

 BRUTUS. AEdiles, seize him.

 PLEBEIANS. Yield, Marcius, yield.

 MENENIUS. Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,

 Hear me but a word.

 AEDILES. Peace, peace!

 MENENIUS. Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,

 And temp'rately proceed to what you would

 Thus violently redress.

 BRUTUS. Sir, those cold ways,

 That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous

 Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him

 And bear him to the rock.

 [CORIOLANUS draws his sword] CORIOLANUS. No: I'll die here.

 There's some among you have beheld me fighting;

 Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

 MENENIUS. Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile. BRUTUS. Lay hands upon him.

 MENENIUS. Help Marcius, help,

 You that be noble; help him, young and old.

 PLEBEIANS. Down with him, down with him!

 

                        [In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES,

                                       and the people are beat in]

  

 

 MENENIUS. Go, get you to your house; be gone, away.

 All will be nought else.

 SECOND SENATOR. Get you gone.

 CORIOLANUS. Stand fast;

 We have as many friends as enemies.

 MENENIUS. Shall it be put to that?

 FIRST SENATOR. The gods forbid!

 I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;

 Leave us to cure this cause.

 MENENIUS. For 'tis a sore upon us

 You cannot tent yourself; be gone, beseech you.

 COMINIUS. Come, sir, along with us.

 CORIOLANUS. I would they were barbarians, as they are,

 Though in Rome litter'd; not Romans, as they are not,

 Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol.

 MENENIUS. Be gone.

 Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;

 One time will owe another.

 CORIOLANUS. On fair ground

 I could beat forty of them.

 MENENIUS. I could myself

 Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes. COMINIUS. But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,

 And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands

 Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,

 Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend

 Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear

 What they are us'd to bear.

 MENENIUS. Pray you be gone.

 I'll try whether my old wit be in request

 With those that have but little; this must be patch'd

 With cloth of any colour.

 COMINIUS. Nay, come away.

 Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS, with others PATRICIANS. This man has marr'd his fortune.

 MENENIUS. His nature is too noble for the world:

 He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,

 Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;

 What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;

 And, being angry, does forget that ever

 He heard the name of death. [A noise within] Here's goodly work!

 PATRICIANS. I would they were a-bed.

 MENENIUS. I would they were in Tiber.

 What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair?

 Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, the rabble again

 SICINIUS. Where is this viper

 That would depopulate the city and

 Be every man himself?

 MENENIUS. You worthy TribunesSICINIUS.

 He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock

 With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law,

 And therefore law shall scorn him further trial

 Than the severity of the public power,

 Which he so sets at nought.

 FIRST CITIZEN. He shall well know

 The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,

 And we their hands.

 PLEBEIANS. He shall, sure on't.

 MENENIUS. Sir, sirSICINIUS.

 Peace!

 MENENIUS. Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt

 With modest warrant.

 SICINIUS. Sir, how comes't that you

 Have holp to make this rescue?

 MENENIUS. Hear me speak.

 As I do know the consul's worthiness,

 So can I name his faults.

 SICINIUS. Consul! What consul?

 MENENIUS. The consul Coriolanus.

 BRUTUS. He consul!

 PLEBEIANS. No, no, no, no, no.

 MENENIUS. If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people, I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;

 The which shall turn you to no further harm

 Than so much loss of time.

 SICINIUS. Speak briefly, then,

 For we are peremptory to dispatch

 This viperous traitor; to eject him hence

 Were but one danger, and to keep him here

 Our certain death; therefore it is decreed

 He dies to-night.

 MENENIUS. Now the good gods forbid

 That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude

 Towards her deserved children is enroll'd

 In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam

 Should now eat up her own!

 SICINIUS. He's a disease that must be cut away.

 MENENIUS. O, he's a limb that has but a diseaseMortal,

 to cut it off: to cure it, easy.

 What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?

 Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lostWhich

 I dare vouch is more than that he hath

 By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;

 And what is left, to lose it by his country

 Were to us all that do't and suffer it

 A brand to th' end o' th' world.

 SICINIUS. This is clean kam.

 BRUTUS. Merely awry. When he did love his country,

 It honour'd him.

 SICINIUS. The service of the foot,

 Being once gangren'd, is not then respected

 For what before it was.

 BRUTUS. We'll hear no more.

 Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,

 Lest his infection, being of catching nature,

 Spread further.

 MENENIUS. One word more, one word

 This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find

 The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,

 Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,

 Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out,

 And sack great Rome with Romans.

 BRUTUS. If it were soSICINIUS.

 What do ye talk?

 Have we not had a taste of his obedienceOur

 aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!

 MENENIUS. Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars

 Since 'a could draw a sword, and is ill school'd

 In bolted language; meal and bran together

 He throws without distinction. Give me leave,

 I'll go to him and undertake to bring him

 Where he shall answer by a lawful form,

 In peace, to his utmost peril.

 FIRST SENATOR. Noble Tribunes,

 It is the humane way; the other course

 Will prove too bloody, and the end of it

 Unknown to the beginning.

 SICINIUS. Noble Menenius,

 Be you then as the people's officer.

 Masters, lay down your weapons.

 BRUTUS. Go not home.

 SICINIUS. Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there; Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed

 In our first way.

 MENENIUS. I'll bring him to you.

 [To the SENATORS] Let me desire your company; he must come, Or what is worst will follow.

 FIRST SENATOR. Pray you let's to him. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Rome. The house of CORIOLANUS

 Enter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES

 CORIOLANUS. Let them pull all about mine ears, present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels;

 Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,

 That the precipitation might down stretch

 Below the beam of sight; yet will I still

 Be thus to them.

 FIRST PATRICIAN. You do the nobler.

 CORIOLANUS. I muse my mother

 Does not approve me further, who was wont

 To call them woollen vassals, things created

 To buy and sell with groats; to show bare heads

 In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder,

 When one but of my ordinance stood up

 To speak of peace or war.

 Enter VOLUMNIA

 I talk of you:

 Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me

 False to my nature? Rather say I play

 The man I am.

 VOLUMNIA. O, sir, sir, sir,

 I would have had you put your power well on

 Before you had worn it out.

 CORIOLANUS. Let go.

 VOLUMNIA. You might have been enough the man you are

 With striving less to be so; lesser had been

 The thwartings of your dispositions, if

 You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd,

 Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

 CORIOLANUS. Let them hang.

 VOLUMNIA. Ay, and burn too.

 Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS

 MENENIUS. Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough; You must return and mend it.

 FIRST SENATOR. There's no remedy,

 Unless, by not so doing, our good city

 Cleave in the midst and perish.

 VOLUMNIA. Pray be counsell'd;

 I have a heart as little apt as yours,

 But yet a brain that leads my use of anger

 To better vantage.

 MENENIUS. Well said, noble woman!

 Before he should thus stoop to th' herd, but that

 The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic

 For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,

 Which I can scarcely bear.

 CORIOLANUS. What must I do?

 MENENIUS. Return to th' tribunes.

 CORIOLANUS. Well, what then, what then?

 MENENIUS. Repent what you have spoke.

 CORIOLANUS. For them! I cannot do it to the gods;

 Must I then do't to them?

 VOLUMNIA. You are too absolute;

 Though therein you can never be too noble

 But when extremities speak. I have heard you say

 Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,

 I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me

 In peace what each of them by th' other lose

 That they combine not there.

 CORIOLANUS. Tush, tush!

 MENENIUS. A good demand.

 VOLUMNIA. If it be honour in your wars to seem

 The same you are not, which for your best ends

 You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse

 That it shall hold companionship in peace

 With honour as in war; since that to both

 It stands in like request?

 CORIOLANUS. Why force you this?

 VOLUMNIA. Because that now it lies you on to speak

 To th' people, not by your own instruction,

 Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you,

 But with such words that are but roted in

 Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables

 Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.

 Now, this no more dishonours you at all

 Than to take in a town with gentle words,

 Which else would put you to your fortune and

 The hazard of much blood.

 I would dissemble with my nature where

 My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd

 I should do so in honour. I am in this

 Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;

 And you will rather show our general louts

 How you can frown, than spend a fawn upon 'em

 For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard

 Of what that want might ruin.

 MENENIUS. Noble lady!

 Come, go with us, speak fair; you may salve so,

 Not what is dangerous present, but the los

 Of what is past.

 VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, My son,

 Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;

 And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with themThy

 knee bussing the stones- for in such busines

 Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant

 More learned than the ears- waving thy head,

 Which often thus correcting thy-stout heart,

 Now humble as the ripest mulberry

 That will not hold the handling. Or say to them

 Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,

 Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,

 Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,

 In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame

 Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far

 As thou hast power and person.

 MENENIUS. This but done

 Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;

 For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free

 As words to little purpose.

 VOLUMNIA. Prithee now,

 Go, and be rul'd; although I know thou hadst rather

 Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf

 Than flatter him in a bower.

 Enter COMINIUS

 Here is Cominius.

 COMINIUS. I have been i' th' market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit You make strong party, or defend yourself

 By calmness or by absence; all's in anger.

 MENENIUS. Only fair speech.

 COMINIUS. I think 'twill serve, if he

 Can thereto frame his spirit.

 VOLUMNIA. He must and will.

 Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

 CORIOLANUS. Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? Must I With my base tongue give to my noble heart

 A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;

 Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,

 This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it,

 And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place!

 You have put me now to such a part which never

 I shall discharge to th' life.

 COMINIUS. Come, come, we'll prompt you.

 VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said

 My praises made thee first a soldier, so,

 To have my praise for this, perform a part

 Thou hast not done before.

 CORIOLANUS. Well, I must do't.

 Away, my disposition, and possess me

 Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd,

 Which quier'd with my drum, into a pipe

 Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice

 That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves

 Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up

 The glasses of my sight! A beggar's tongue

 Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,

 Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his

 That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do't,

 Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,

 And by my body's action teach my mind

 A most inherent baseness.

 VOLUMNIA. At thy choice, then.

 To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour

 Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let

 Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear

 Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death

 With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.

 Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me;

 But owe thy pride thyself.

 CORIOLANUS. Pray be content.

 Mother, I am going to the market-place;

 Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,

 Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd

 Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.

 Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,

 Or never trust to what my tongue can do

 I' th' way of flattery further.

 VOLUMNIA. Do your will. Exit COMINIUS. Away! The tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself

 To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd

 With accusations, as I hear, more strong

 Than are upon you yet.

 CORIOLANUS. The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go.

 Let them accuse me by invention; I

 Will answer in mine honour.

 MENENIUS. Ay, but mildly.

 CORIOLANUS. Well, mildly be it then- mildly. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Rome. The Forum

 Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

 BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he affects

 Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,

 Enforce him with his envy to the people,

 And that the spoil got on the Antiates

 Was ne'er distributed.

 Enter an AEDILE

 What, will he come?

 AEDILE. He's coming.

 BRUTUS. How accompanied?

 AEDILE. With old Menenius, and those senators

 That always favour'd him.

 SICINIUS. Have you a catalogue

 Of all the voices that we have procur'd,

 Set down by th' poll?

 AEDILE. I have; 'tis ready.

 SICINIUS. Have you corrected them by tribes?

 AEDILE. I have.

 SICINIUS. Assemble presently the people hither;

 And when they hear me say 'It shall be so

 I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either

 For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,

 If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death!'

 Insisting on the old prerogative

 And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.

 AEDILE. I shall inform them.

 BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry,

 Let them not cease, but with a din confus'd

 Enforce the present execution

 Of what we chance to sentence.

 AEDILE. Very well.

 SICINIUS. Make them be strong, and ready for this hint,

 When we shall hap to give't them.

 BRUTUS. Go about it. Exit AEDILE Put him to choler straight. He hath been us'd

 Ever to conquer, and to have his worth

 Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he cannot

 Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks

 What's in his heart, and that is there which looks

 With us to break his neck.

 Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS and COMINIUS, with others

 SICINIUS. Well, here he comes.

 MENENIUS. Calmly, I do beseech you.

 CORIOLANUS. Ay, as an ostler, that for th' poorest piece

 Will bear the knave by th' volume. Th' honour'd gods

 Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice

 Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's!

 Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,

 And not our streets with war!

 FIRST SENATOR. Amen, amen!

 MENENIUS. A noble wish.

 Re-enter the.AEDILE,with the plebeians

 SICINIUS. Draw near, ye people.

 AEDILE. List to your tribunes. Audience! peace, I say!

 CORIOLANUS. First, hear me speak.

 BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, say. Peace, ho!

 CORIOLANUS. Shall I be charg'd no further than this present? Must all determine here?

 SICINIUS. I do demand,

 If you submit you to the people's voices,

 Allow their officers, and are content

 To suffer lawful censure for such faults

 As shall be prov'd upon you.

 CORIOLANUS. I am content.

 MENENIUS. Lo, citizens, he says he is content.

 The warlike service he has done, consider; think

 Upon the wounds his body bears, which show

 Like graves i' th' holy churchyard.

 CORIOLANUS. Scratches with briers,

 Scars to move laughter only.

 MENENIUS. Consider further,

 That when he speaks not like a citizen,

 You find him like a soldier; do not take

 His rougher accents for malicious sounds,

 But, as I say, such as become a soldier

 Rather than envy you.

 COMINIUS. Well, well! No more.

 CORIOLANUS. What is the matter,

 That being pass'd for consul with full voice,

 I am so dishonour'd that the very hour

 You take it off again?

 SICINIUS. Answer to us.

 CORIOLANUS. Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.

 SICINIUS. We charge you that you have contriv'd to take

 From Rome all season'd office, and to wind

 Yourself into a power tyrannical;

 For which you are a traitor to the people.

 CORIOLANUS. How- traitor?

 MENENIUS. Nay, temperately! Your promise.

 CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people! Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!

 Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,

 In thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in

 Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say

 'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free

 As I do pray the gods.

 SICINIUS. Mark you this, people?

 PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!

 SICINIUS. Peace!

 We need not put new matter to his charge.

 What you have seen him do and heard him speak,

 Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,

 Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying

 Those whose great power must try him- even this,

 So criminal and in such capital kind,

 Deserves th' extremest death.

 BRUTUS. But since he hath

 Serv'd well for RomeCORIOLANUS.

 What do you prate of service?

 BRUTUS. I talk of that that know it.

 CORIOLANUS. You!

 MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother?

 COMINIUS. Know, I pray youCORIOLANUS.

 I'll know no further.

 Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,

 Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger

 But with a grain a day, I would not buy

 Their mercy at the price of one fair word,

 Nor check my courage for what they can give,

 To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

 SICINIUS. For that he hasAs

 much as in him lies- from time to time

 Envied against the people, seeking means

 To pluck away their power; as now at last

 Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence

 Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers

 That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,

 And in the power of us the tribunes, we,

 Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city,

 In peril of precipitation

 From off the rock Tarpeian, never more

 To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name,

 I say it shall be so.

 PLEBEIANS. It shall be so, it shall be so! Let him away!

 He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

 COMINIUS. Hear me, my masters and my common friendsSICINIUS.

 He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.

 COMINIUS. Let me speak.

 I have been consul, and can show for Rome

 Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love

 My country's good with a respect more tender,

 More holy and profound, than mine own life,

 My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase

 And treasure of my loins. Then if I would

 Speak thatSICINIUS.

 We know your drift. Speak what?

 BRUTUS. There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,

 As enemy to the people and his country.

 It shall be so.

 PLEBEIANS. It shall be so, it shall be so.

 CORIOLANUS. YOU common cry of curs, whose breath I hate

 As reek o' th' rotten fens, whose loves I prize

 As the dead carcasses of unburied men

 That do corrupt my air- I banish you.

 And here remain with your uncertainty!

 Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts;

 Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,

 Fan you into despair! Have the power still

 To banish your defenders, till at length

 Your ignorance- which finds not till it feels,

 Making but reservation of yourselves

 Still your own foes- deliver you

 As most abated captives to some nation

 That won you without blows! Despising

 For you the city, thus I turn my back;

 There is a world elsewhere.

 

                                                Exeunt CORIOLANUS,

                     COMINIUS, MENENIUS, with the other PATRICIANS

    AEDILE. The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

                          [They all shout and throw up their caps]

  

 

 PLEBEIANS. Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone! Hoo-oo!

 SICINIUS. Go see him out at gates, and follow him,

 As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;

 Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard

 Attend us through the city.

 PLEBEIANS. Come, come, let's see him out at gates; come!

 The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come. Exeunt

 ACT IV. SCENE I.

 Rome. Before a gate of the city

 Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS,

 with the young NOBILITY of Rome

 CORIOLANUS. Come, leave your tears; a brief farewell. The beast With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,

 Where is your ancient courage? You were us'd

 To say extremities was the trier of spirits;

 That common chances common men could bear;

 That when the sea was calm all boats alike

 Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,

 When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves

 A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me

 With precepts that would make invincible

 The heart that conn'd them.

 VIRGILIA. O heavens! O heavens!

 CORIOLANUS. Nay, I prithee, womanVOLUMNIA.

 Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,

 And occupations perish!

 CORIOLANUS. What, what, what!

 I shall be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,

 Resume that spirit when you were wont to say,

 If you had been the wife of Hercules,

 Six of his labours you'd have done, and sav'd

 Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,

 Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother.

 I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,

 Thy tears are salter than a younger man's

 And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime General,

 I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld

 Heart-hard'ning spectacles; tell these sad women

 'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,

 As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well

 My hazards still have been your solace; and

 Believe't not lightly- though I go alone,

 Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen

 Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen- your son

 Will or exceed the common or be caught

 With cautelous baits and practice.

 VOLUMNIA. My first son,

 Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius

 With thee awhile; determine on some course

 More than a wild exposture to each chance

 That starts i' th' way before thee.

 VIRGILIA. O the gods!

 COMINIUS. I'll follow thee a month, devise with the

 Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us,

 And we of thee; so, if the time thrust forth

 A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send

 O'er the vast world to seek a single man,

 And lose advantage, which doth ever cool

 I' th' absence of the needer.

 CORIOLANUS. Fare ye well;

 Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full

 Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one

 That's yet unbruis'd; bring me but out at gate.

 Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and

 My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,

 Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you come.

 While I remain above the ground you shall

 Hear from me still, and never of me aught

 But what is like me formerly.

 MENENIUS. That's worthily

 As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.

 If I could shake off but one seven years

 From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,

 I'd with thee every foot.

 CORIOLANUS. Give me thy hand.

 Come. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Rome. A street near the gate

 Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS with the AEDILE

 SICINIUS. Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further. The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided

 In his behalf.

 BRUTUS. Now we have shown our power,

 Let us seem humbler after it is done

 Than when it was a-doing.

 SICINIUS. Bid them home.

 Say their great enemy is gone, and they

 Stand in their ancient strength.

 BRUTUS. Dismiss them home. Exit AEDILE Here comes his mother.

 Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS

 SICINIUS. Let's not meet her.

 BRUTUS. Why?

 SICINIUS. They say she's mad.

 BRUTUS. They have ta'en note of us; keep on your way.

 VOLUMNIA. O, Y'are well met; th' hoarded plague o' th' gods Requite your love!

 MENENIUS. Peace, peace, be not so loud.

 VOLUMNIA. If that I could for weeping, you should hearNay,

 and you shall hear some. [To BRUTUS] Will you be gone? VIRGILIA. [To SICINIUS] You shall stay too. I would I had the

 power

 To say so to my husband.

 SICINIUS. Are you mankind?

 VOLUMNIA. Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this, fool: Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship

 To banish him that struck more blows for Rome

 Than thou hast spoken words?

 SICINIUS. O blessed heavens!

 VOLUMNIA. Moe noble blows than ever thou wise words;

 And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what- yet go!

 Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son

 Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,

 His good sword in his hand.

 SICINIUS. What then?

 VIRGILIA. What then!

 He'd make an end of thy posterity.

 VOLUMNIA. Bastards and all.

 Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

 MENENIUS. Come, come, peace.

 SICINIUS. I would he had continued to his country

 As he began, and not unknit himself

 The noble knot he made.

 BRUTUS. I would he had.

 VOLUMNIA. 'I would he had!' 'Twas you incens'd the rabbleCats that can judge as fitly of his worth

 As I can of those mysteries which heaven

 Will not have earth to know.

 BRUTUS. Pray, let's go.

 VOLUMNIA. Now, pray, sir, get you gone;

 You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:

 As far as doth the Capitol exceed

 The meanest house in Rome, so far my sonThis

 lady's husband here, this, do you see?-

 Whom you have banish'd does exceed you an.

 BRUTUS. Well, well, we'll leave you.

 SICINIUS. Why stay we to be baited

 With one that wants her wits? Exeunt TRIBUNES VOLUMNIA. Take my prayers with you.

 I would the gods had nothing else to do

 But to confirm my curses. Could I meet 'em

 But once a day, it would unclog my heart

 Of what lies heavy to't.

 MENENIUS. You have told them home,

 And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

 VOLUMNIA. Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,

 And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.

 Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,

 In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

 

                                      Exeunt VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA

    MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!                                  Exit

  

 

 SCENE III.

 A highway between Rome and Antium

 Enter a ROMAN and a VOLSCE, meeting

 ROMAN. I know you well, sir, and you know me; your name, I think, is Adrian.

 VOLSCE. It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.

 ROMAN. I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em. Know you me yet?

 VOLSCE. Nicanor? No!

 ROMAN. The same, sir.

 VOLSCE. YOU had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is well appear'd by your tongue. What's the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state, to find you out there. You have well saved me a day's journey.

 ROMAN. There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.

 VOLSCE. Hath been! Is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so; they are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.

 ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent breaking out.

 VOLSCE. Coriolanus banish'd!

 ROMAN. Banish'd, sir.

 VOLSCE. You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor. ROMAN. The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request of his country.

 VOLSCE. He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you; you have ended my business, and I will merrily accompany you home.

 ROMAN. I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from Rome, all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

 VOLSCE. A most royal one: the centurions and their charges, distinctly billeted, already in th' entertainment, and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

 ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.

 VOLSCE. You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be glad of yours.

 ROMAN. Well, let us go together.

 SCENE IV.

 Antium. Before AUFIDIUS' house

 Enter CORIOLANUS, in mean apparel, disguis'd and muffled

 CORIOLANUS. A goodly city is this Antium. City,

 'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir

 Of these fair edifices fore my wars

 Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not.

 Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones,

 In puny battle slay me.

 Enter A CITIZEN

 Save you, sir.

 CITIZEN. And you.

 CORIOLANUS. Direct me, if it be your will,

 Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?

 CITIZEN. He is, and feasts the nobles of the state

 At his house this night.

 CORIOLANUS. Which is his house, beseech you?

 CITIZEN. This here before you.

 CORIOLANUS. Thank you, sir; farewell. Exit CITIZEN O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,

 Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart,

 Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise

 Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love,

 Unseparable, shall within this hour,

 On a dissension of a doit, break out

 To bitterest enmity; so fellest foes,

 Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep

 To take the one the other, by some chance,

 Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends

 And interjoin their issues. So with me:

 My birthplace hate I, and my love's upon

 This enemy town. I'll enter. If he slay me,

 He does fair justice: if he give me way,

 I'll do his country service.

 SCENE V.

 Antium. AUFIDIUS' house

 Music plays. Enter A SERVINGMAN

 FIRST SERVANT. Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our fellows are asleep. Exit

 Enter another SERVINGMAN

 SECOND SERVANT.Where's Cotus? My master calls for him.

 Cotus! Exit

 Enter CORIOLANUS

 CORIOLANUS. A goodly house. The feast smells well, but I

 Appear not like a guest.

 Re-enter the first SERVINGMAN

 FIRST SERVANT. What would you have, friend?

 Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the door. Exit

 CORIOLANUS. I have deserv'd no better entertainment

 In being Coriolanus.

 Re-enter second SERVINGMAN

 SECOND SERVANT. Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray get you out. CORIOLANUS. Away!

 SECOND SERVANT. Away? Get you away.

 CORIOLANUS. Now th' art troublesome.

 SECOND SERVANT. Are you so brave? I'll have you talk'd with anon.

 Enter a third SERVINGMAN. The first meets him

 THIRD SERVANT. What fellow's this?

 FIRST SERVANT. A strange one as ever I look'd on. I cannot get him out o' th' house. Prithee call my master to him.

 THIRD SERVANT. What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you avoid the house.

 CORIOLANUS. Let me but stand- I will not hurt your hearth. THIRD SERVANT. What are you?

 CORIOLANUS. A gentleman.

 THIRD SERVANT. A marv'llous poor one.

 CORIOLANUS. True, so I am.

 THIRD SERVANT. Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other station; here's no place for you. Pray you avoid. Come. CORIOLANUS. Follow your function, go and batten on cold bits.

 [Pushes him away from him] THIRD SERVANT. What, you will not? Prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here.

 SECOND SERVANT. And I shall. Exit THIRD SERVANT. Where dwell'st thou?

 CORIOLANUS. Under the canopy.

 THIRD SERVANT. Under the canopy?

 CORIOLANUS. Ay.

 THIRD SERVANT. Where's that?

 CORIOLANUS. I' th' city of kites and crows.

 THIRD SERVANT. I' th' city of kites and crows!

 What an ass it is! Then thou dwell'st with daws too?

 CORIOLANUS. No, I serve not thy master.

 THIRD SERVANT. How, sir! Do you meddle with my master?

 CORIOLANUS. Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress. Thou prat'st and prat'st; serve with thy trencher; hence! [Beats him away]

 Enter AUFIDIUS with the second SERVINGMAN

 AUFIDIUS. Where is this fellow?

 SECOND SERVANT. Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for disturbing the lords within.

 AUFIDIUS. Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name? Why speak'st not? Speak, man. What's thy name?

 CORIOLANUS. [Unmuffling] If, Tullus,

 Not yet thou know'st me, and, seeing me, dost not

 Think me for the man I am, necessity

 Commands me name myself.

 AUFIDIUS. What is thy name?

 CORIOLANUS. A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,

 And harsh in sound to thine.

 AUFIDIUS. Say, what's thy name?

 Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face

 Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn,

 Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?

 CORIOLANUS. Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet? AUFIDIUS. I know thee not. Thy name?

 CORIOLANUS. My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done

 To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,

 Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may

 My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,

 The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood

 Shed for my thankless country, are requited

 But with that surname- a good memory

 And witness of the malice and displeasure

 Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;

 The cruelty and envy of the people,

 Permitted by our dastard nobles, who

 Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,

 An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be

 Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity

 Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,

 Mistake me not, to save my life; for if

 I had fear'd death, of all the men i' th' world

 I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,

 To be full quit of those my banishers,

 Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast

 A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge

 Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims

 Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight

 And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it

 That my revengeful services may prove

 As benefits to thee; for I will fight

 Against my cank'red country with the spleen

 Of all the under fiends. But if so be

 Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes

 Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am

 Longer to live most weary, and present

 My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;

 Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,

 Since I have ever followed thee with hate,

 Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,

 And cannot live but to thy shame, unless

 It be to do thee service.

 AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius!

 Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart

 A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter

 Should from yond cloud speak divine things,

 And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more

 Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine

 Mine arms about that body, where against

 My grained ash an hundred times hath broke

 And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip

 The anvil of my sword, and do contest

 As hotly and as nobly with thy love

 As ever in ambitious strength I did

 Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,

 I lov'd the maid I married; never man

 Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,

 Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart

 Than when I first my wedded mistress saw

 Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell the

 We have a power on foot, and I had purpose

 Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,

 Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out

 Twelve several times, and I have nightly since

 Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and meWe

 have been down together in my sleep,

 Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throatAnd

 wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,

 Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that

 Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all

 From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war

 Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,

 Like a bold flood o'erbeat. O, come, go in,

 And take our friendly senators by th' hands,

 Who now are here, taking their leaves of me

 Who am prepar'd against your territories,

 Though not for Rome itself.

 CORIOLANUS. You bless me, gods!

 AUFIDIUS. Therefore, most. absolute sir, if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges, take

 Th' one half of my commission, and set downAs

 best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st

 Thy country's strength and weakness- thine own ways,

 Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,

 Or rudely visit them in parts remote

 To fright them ere destroy. But come in;

 Let me commend thee first to those that shall

 Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!

 And more a friend than e'er an enemy;

 Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand; most welcome!

 Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS

 The two SERVINGMEN come forward

 FIRST SERVANT. Here's a strange alteration!

 SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him.

 FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

 SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I cannot tell how to term it.

 FIRST SERVANT. He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd, but I thought there was more in him than I could think. SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'll be sworn. He is simply the rarest man i' th' world.

 FIRST SERVANT. I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot on.

 SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master?

 FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no matter for that.

 SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him.

 FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the greater soldier.

 SECOND SERVANT. Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that; for the defence of a town our general is excellent.

 FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an assault too.

 Re-enter the third SERVINGMAN

 THIRD SERVANT. O slaves, I can tell you news- news, you rascals! BOTH. What, what, what? Let's partake.

 THIRD SERVANT. I would not be a Roman, of all nations;

 I had as lief be a condemn'd man.

 BOTH. Wherefore? wherefore?

 THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our generalCaius Marcius.

 FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say 'thwack our general'?

 THIRD SERVANT. I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always good enough for him.

 SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.

 FIRST SERVANT. He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a carbonado.

 SECOND SERVANT. An he had been cannibally given, he might have broil'd and eaten him too.

 FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news!

 THIRD SERVANT. Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' th' middle and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he will mow all down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.

 SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine. THIRD SERVANT. Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends, whilst he's in directitude.

 FIRST SERVANT. Directitude? What's that?

 THIRD SERVANT. But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies after rain, and revel an with him.

 FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward?

 THIRD SERVANT. To-morrow, to-day, presently. You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis as it were parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.

 SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

 FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.

 SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.

 FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

 THIRD SERVANT. Reason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.

 BOTH. In, in, in, in! Exeunt

 SCENE VI.

 Rome. A public place

 Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS

 SICINIUS. We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.

 His remedies are tame. The present peace

 And quietness of the people, which before

 Were in wild hurry, here do make his friends

 Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,

 Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold

 Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see

 Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going

 About their functions friendly.

 Enter MENENIUS

 BRUTUS. We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius?

 SICINIUS. 'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind

 Of late. Hail, sir!

 MENENIUS. Hail to you both!

 SICINIUS. Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd

 But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,

 And so would do, were he more angry at it.

 MENENIUS. All's well, and might have been much better

 He could have temporiz'd.

 SICINIUS. Where is he, hear you?

 MENENIUS. Nay, I hear nothing; his mother and his wife

 Hear nothing from him.

 Enter three or four citizens

 CITIZENS. The gods preserve you both!

 SICINIUS. God-den, our neighbours.

 BRUTUS. God-den to you all, god-den to you an.

 FIRST CITIZEN. Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees Are bound to pray for you both.

 SICINIUS. Live and thrive!

 BRUTUS. Farewell, kind neighbours; we wish'd Coriolanus

 Had lov'd you as we did.

 CITIZENS. Now the gods keep you!

 BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewell, farewell. Exeunt citizens SICINIUS. This is a happier and more comely time

 Than when these fellows ran about the streets

 Crying confusion.

 BRUTUS. Caius Marcius was

 A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,

 O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,

 Self-lovingSICINIUS.

 And affecting one sole throne,

 Without assistance.

 MENENIUS. I think not so.

 SICINIUS. We should by this, to all our lamentation,

 If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

 BRUTUS. The gods have well prevented it, and Rome

 Sits safe and still without him.

 Enter an AEDILE

 AEDILE. Worthy tribunes,

 There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,

 Reports the Volsces with several powers

 Are ent'red in the Roman territories,

 And with the deepest malice of the war

 Destroy what lies before 'em.

 MENENIUS. 'Tis Aufidius,

 Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,

 Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,

 Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,

 And durst not once peep out.

 SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius?

 BRUTUS. Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be

 The Volsces dare break with us.

 MENENIUS. Cannot be!

 We have record that very well it can;

 And three examples of the like hath been

 Within my age. But reason with the fellow

 Before you punish him, where he heard this,

 Lest you shall chance to whip your information

 And beat the messenger who bids beware

 Of what is to be dreaded.

 SICINIUS. Tell not me.

 I know this cannot be.

 BRUTUS. Not Possible.

 Enter A MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. The nobles in great earnestness are going

 All to the Senate House; some news is come

 That turns their countenances.

 SICINIUS. 'Tis this slaveGo

 whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising,

 Nothing but his report.

 MESSENGER. Yes, worthy sir,

 The slave's report is seconded, and more,

 More fearful, is deliver'd.

 SICINIUS. What more fearful?

 MESSENGER. It is spoke freely out of many mouthsHow

 probable I do not know- that Marcius,

 Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,

 And vows revenge as spacious as between

 The young'st and oldest thing.

 SICINIUS. This is most likely!

 BRUTUS. Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish

 Good Marcius home again.

 SICINIUS. The very trick on 't.

 MENENIUS. This is unlikely.

 He and Aufidius can no more atone

 Than violent'st contrariety.

 Enter a second MESSENGER

 SECOND MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Senate.

 A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius

 Associated with Aufidius, rages

 Upon our territories, and have already

 O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and took

 What lay before them.

 Enter COMINIUS

 COMINIUS. O, you have made good work!

 MENENIUS. What news? what news?

 COMINIUS. You have holp to ravish your own daughters and

 To melt the city leads upon your pates,

 To see your wives dishonour'd to your nosesMENENIUS.

 What's the news? What's the news?

 COMINIUS. Your temples burned in their cement, and

 Your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd

 Into an auger's bore.

 MENENIUS. Pray now, your news?

 You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news.

 If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' VolsciansCOMINIUS.

 If!

 He is their god; he leads them like a thing

 Made by some other deity than Nature,

 That shapes man better; and they follow him

 Against us brats with no less confidence

 Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,

 Or butchers killing flies.

 MENENIUS. You have made good work,

 You and your apron men; you that stood so much

 Upon the voice of occupation and

 The breath of garlic-eaters!

 COMINIUS. He'll shake

 Your Rome about your ears.

 MENENIUS. As Hercules

 Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work!

 BRUTUS. But is this true, sir?

 COMINIUS. Ay; and you'll look pale

 Before you find it other. All the regions

 Do smilingly revolt, and who resists

 Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,

 And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?

 Your enemies and his find something in him.

 MENENIUS. We are all undone unless

 The noble man have mercy.

 COMINIUS. Who shall ask it?

 The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people

 Deserve such pity of him as the wolf

 Does of the shepherds; for his best friends, if they

 Should say 'Be good to Rome'- they charg'd him even

 As those should do that had deserv'd his hate,

 And therein show'd fike enemies.

 MENENIUS. 'Tis true;

 If he were putting to my house the brand

 That should consume it, I have not the face

 To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,

 You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!

 COMINIUS. You have brought

 A trembling upon Rome, such as was never

 S' incapable of help.

 BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not we brought it.

 MENENIUS. How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like beasts

 And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,

 Who did hoot him out o' th' city.

 COMINIUS. But I fear

 They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,

 The second name of men, obeys his points

 As if he were his officer. Desperation

 Is all the policy, strength, and defence,

 That Rome can make against them.

 Enter a troop of citizens

 MENENIUS. Here comes the clusters.

 And is Aufidius with him? You are they

 That made the air unwholesome when you cast

 Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at

 Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming,

 And not a hair upon a soldier's head

 Which will not prove a whip; as many coxcombs

 As you threw caps up will he tumble down,

 And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;

 If he could burn us all into one coal

 We have deserv'd it.

 PLEBEIANS. Faith, we hear fearful news.

 FIRST CITIZEN. For mine own part,

 When I said banish him, I said 'twas pity.

 SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I.

 THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our will.

 COMINIUS. Y'are goodly things, you voices!

 MENENIUS. You have made

 Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?

 COMINIUS. O, ay, what else?

 Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;

 These are a side that would be glad to have

 This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,

 And show no sign of fear.

 FIRST CITIZEN. The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. I ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd him.

 SECOND CITIZEN. So did we all. But come, let's home.

 Exeunt citizens BRUTUS. I do not like this news.

 SICINIUS. Nor I.

 BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth

 Would buy this for a lie!

 SICINIUS. Pray let's go. Exeunt

 SCENE VII.

 A camp at a short distance from Rome

 Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT

 AUFIDIUS. Do they still fly to th' Roman?

 LIEUTENANT. I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but

 Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat,

 Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;

 And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,

 Even by your own.

 AUFIDIUS. I cannot help it now,

 Unless by using means I lame the foot

 Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,

 Even to my person, than I thought he would

 When first I did embrace him; yet his nature

 In that's no changeling, and I must excuse

 What cannot be amended.

 LIEUTENANT. Yet I wish, sirI

 mean, for your particular- you had not

 Join'd in commission with him, but either

 Had borne the action of yourself, or else

 To him had left it solely.

 AUFIDIUS. I understand thee well; and be thou sure,

 When he shall come to his account, he knows not

 What I can urge against him. Although it seems,

 And so he thinks, and is no less apparent

 To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly

 And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,

 Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon

 As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone

 That which shall break his neck or hazard mine

 Whene'er we come to our account.

 LIEUTENANT. Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome? AUFIDIUS. All places yield to him ere he sits down,

 And the nobility of Rome are his;

 The senators and patricians love him too.

 The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people

 Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty

 To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome

 As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it

 By sovereignty of nature. First he was

 A noble servant to them, but he could not

 Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas pride,

 Which out of daily fortune ever taints

 The happy man; whether defect of judgment,

 To fail in the disposing of those chances

 Which he was lord of; or whether nature,

 Not to be other than one thing, not moving

 From th' casque to th' cushion, but commanding peace

 Even with the same austerity and garb

 As he controll'd the war; but one of theseAs

 he hath spices of them all- not all,

 For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,

 So hated, and so banish'd. But he has a merit

 To choke it in the utt'rance. So our virtues

 Lie in th' interpretation of the time;

 And power, unto itself most commendable,

 Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair

 T' extol what it hath done.

 One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;

 Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail. Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,

 Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

 Exeunt

 ACT V. SCENE I.

 Rome. A public place

 Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS and BRUTUS, the two Tribunes, with others

 MENENIUS. No, I'll not go. You hear what he hath said

 Which was sometime his general, who lov'd him

 In a most dear particular. He call'd me father;

 But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him:

 A mile before his tent fall down, and knee

 The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy'd

 To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

 COMINIUS. He would not seem to know me.

 MENENIUS. Do you hear?

 COMINIUS. Yet one time he did call me by my name.

 I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops

 That we have bled together. 'Coriolanus'

 He would not answer to; forbid all names;

 He was a kind of nothing, titleless,

 Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire

 Of burning Rome.

 MENENIUS. Why, so! You have made good work.

 A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome

 To make coals cheap- a noble memory!

 COMINIUS. I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon

 When it was less expected; he replied,

 It was a bare petition of a state

 To one whom they had punish'd.

 MENENIUS. Very well.

 Could he say less?

 COMINIUS. I offer'd to awaken his regard

 For's private friends; his answer to me was,

 He could not stay to pick them in a pile

 Of noisome musty chaff. He said 'twas folly,

 For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt

 And still to nose th' offence.

 MENENIUS. For one poor grain or two!

 I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child,

 And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:

 You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt

 Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.

 SICINIUS. Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid

 In this so never-needed help, yet do not

 Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you

 Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,

 More than the instant army we can make,

 Might stop our countryman.

 MENENIUS. No; I'll not meddle.

 SICINIUS. Pray you go to him.

 MENENIUS. What should I do?

 BRUTUS. Only make trial what your love can do

 For Rome, towards Marcius.

 MENENIUS. Well, and say that Marcius

 Return me, as Cominius is return'd,

 Unheard- what then?

 But as a discontented friend, grief-shot

 With his unkindness? Say't be so?

 SICINIUS. Yet your good will

 Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure

 As you intended well.

 MENENIUS. I'll undertake't;

 I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip

 And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.

 He was not taken well: he had not din'd;

 The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then

 We pout upon the morning, are unapt

 To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd

 These pipes and these conveyances of our blood

 With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls

 Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'll watch him Till he be dieted to my request,

 And then I'll set upon him.

 BRUTUS. You know the very road into his kindness

 And cannot lose your way.

 MENENIUS. Good faith, I'll prove him,

 Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge

 Of my success. Exit COMINIUS. He'll never hear him.

 SICINIUS. Not?

 COMINIUS. I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye

 Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury

 The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;

 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me

 Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do,

 He sent in writing after me; what he would not,

 Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions;

 So that all hope is vain,

 Unless his noble mother and his wife,

 Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him

 For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,

 And with our fair entreaties haste them on. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 The Volscian camp before Rome

 Enter MENENIUS to the WATCH on guard

 FIRST WATCH. Stay. Whence are you?

 SECOND WATCH. Stand, and go back.

 MENENIUS. You guard like men, 'tis well; but, by your leave, I am an officer of state and come

 To speak with Coriolanus.

 FIRST WATCH. From whence?

 MENENIUS. From Rome.

 FIRST WATCH. YOU may not pass; you must return. Our general Will no more hear from thence.

 SECOND WATCH. You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before You'll speak with Coriolanus.

 MENENIUS. Good my friends,

 If you have heard your general talk of Rome

 And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks

 My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.

 FIRST WATCH. Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name

 Is not here passable.

 MENENIUS. I tell thee, fellow,

 Thy general is my lover. I have been

 The book of his good acts whence men have read

 His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;

 For I have ever verified my friendsOf

 whom he's chief- with all the size that verity

 Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,

 Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,

 I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise

 Have almost stamp'd the leasing; therefore, fellow,

 I must have leave to pass.

 FIRST WATCH. Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely. Therefore go back.

 MENENIUS. Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general.

 SECOND WATCH. Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore go back.

 MENENIUS. Has he din'd, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with him till after dinner.

 FIRST WATCH. You are a Roman, are you?

 MENENIUS. I am as thy general is.

 FIRST WATCH. Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied

 intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd; our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.

 MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me with estimation.

 FIRST WATCH. Come, my captain knows you not.

 MENENIUS. I mean thy general.

 FIRST WATCH. My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I let forth your half pint of blood. Back- that's the utmost of your having. Back.

 MENENIUS. Nay, but fellow, fellow-

 Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS

 CORIOLANUS. What's the matter?

 MENENIUS. Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you; you shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this, who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.

 CORIOLANUS. Away!

 MENENIUS. How! away!

 CORIOLANUS. Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs

 Are servanted to others. Though I owe

 My revenge properly, my remission lies

 In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,

 Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather

 Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.

 Mine ears against your suits are stronger than

 Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,

 Take this along; I writ it for thy sake [Gives a letter] And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,

 I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,

 Was my belov'd in Rome; yet thou behold'st.

 AUFIDIUS. You keep a constant temper.

 Exeunt CORIOLANUS and Aufidius FIRST WATCH. Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

 SECOND WATCH. 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power! You know the way home again.

 FIRST WATCH. Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back?

 SECOND WATCH. What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?

 MENENIUS. I neither care for th' world nor your general; for such things as you, I can scarce think there's any, y'are so slight. He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another. Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was said to: Away! Exit FIRST WATCH. A noble fellow, I warrant him.

 SECOND WATCH. The worthy fellow is our general; he's the rock, the oak not to be wind-shaken. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 The tent of CORIOLANUS

 Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others

 CORIOLANUS. We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow

 Set down our host. My partner in this action,

 You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly

 I have borne this business.

 AUFIDIUS. Only their ends

 You have respected; stopp'd your ears against

 The general suit of Rome; never admitted

 A private whisper- no, not with such friends

 That thought them sure of you.

 CORIOLANUS. This last old man,

 Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,

 Lov'd me above the measure of a father;

 Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge

 Was to send him; for whose old love I haveThough

 I show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd

 The first conditions, which they did refuse

 And cannot now accept. To grace him only,

 That thought he could do more, a very little

 I have yielded to; fresh embassies and suits,

 Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter

 Will I lend ear to. [Shout within] Ha! what shout is this? Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow

 In the same time 'tis made? I will not.

 Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, VALERIA,

 YOUNG MARCIUS, with attendants

 My wife comes foremost, then the honour'd mould

 Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand

 The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!

 All bond and privilege of nature, break!

 Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.

 What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,

 Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not

 Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,

 As if Olympus to a molehill should

 In supplication nod; and my young boy

 Hath an aspect of intercession which

 Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces

 Plough Rome and harrow Italy; I'll never

 Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand

 As if a man were author of himself

 And knew no other kin.

 VIRGILIA. My lord and husband!

 CORIOLANUS. These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

 VIRGILIA. The sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd

 Makes you think so.

 CORIOLANUS. Like a dull actor now

 I have forgot my part and I am out,

 Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,

 Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,

 For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss

 Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!

 Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss

 I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip

 Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,

 And the most noble mother of the world

 Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i' th' earth; [Kneels] Of thy deep duty more impression show

 Than that of common sons.

 VOLUMNIA. O, stand up blest!

 Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint

 I kneel before thee, and unproperly

 Show duty, as mistaken all this while

 Between the child and parent. [Kneels] CORIOLANUS. What's this?

 Your knees to me, to your corrected son?

 Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach

 Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds

 Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,

 Murd'ring impossibility, to make

 What cannot be slight work.

 VOLUMNIA. Thou art my warrior;

 I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

 CORIOLANUS. The noble sister of Publicola,

 The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle

 That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,

 And hangs on Dian's temple- dear Valeria!

 VOLUMNIA. This is a poor epitome of yours,

 Which by th' interpretation of full time

 May show like all yourself.

 CORIOLANUS. The god of soldiers,

 With the consent of supreme Jove, inform

 Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove

 To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' th' wars

 Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,

 And saving those that eye thee!

 VOLUMNIA. Your knee, sirrah.

 CORIOLANUS. That's my brave boy.

 VOLUMNIA. Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,

 Are suitors to you.

 CORIOLANUS. I beseech you, peace!

 Or, if you'd ask, remember this before:

 The thing I have forsworn to grant may never

 Be held by you denials. Do not bid me

 Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate

 Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not

 Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not

 T'allay my rages and revenges with

 Your colder reasons.

 VOLUMNIA. O, no more, no more!

 You have said you will not grant us any thingFor

 we have nothing else to ask but that

 Which you deny already; yet we will ask,

 That, if you fail in our request, the blame

 May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.

 CORIOLANUS. Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll

 Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

 VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment

 And state of bodies would bewray what life

 We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself

 How more unfortunate than all living women

 Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should

 Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts, Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,

 Making the mother, wife, and child, to see

 The son, the husband, and the father, tearing

 His country's bowels out. And to poor we

 Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us

 Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort

 That all but we enjoy. For how can we,

 Alas, how can we for our country pray,

 Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,

 Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose

 The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,

 Our comfort in the country. We must find

 An evident calamity, though we had

 Our wish, which side should win; for either thou

 Must as a foreign recreant be led

 With manacles through our streets, or else

 Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,

 And bear the palm for having bravely shed

 Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,

 I purpose not to wait on fortune till

 These wars determine; if I can not persuade thee

 Rather to show a noble grace to both parts

 Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner

 March to assault thy country than to treadTrust

 to't, thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb

 That brought thee to this world.

 VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine,

 That brought you forth this boy to keep your name

 Living to time.

 BOY. 'A shall not tread on me!

 I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.

 CORIOLANUS. Not of a woman's tenderness to be

 Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.

 I have sat too long. [Rising] VOLUMNIA. Nay, go not from us thus.

 If it were so that our request did tend

 To save the Romans, thereby to destroy

 The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us

 As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit

 Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces

 May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans

 'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side

 Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest

 For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,

 The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,

 That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit

 Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name

 Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;

 Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,

 But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,

 Destroy'd his country, and his name remains

 To th' ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son.

 Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,

 To imitate the graces of the gods,

 To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air,

 And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt

 That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?

 Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man

 Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:

 He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;

 Perhaps thy childishness will move him more

 Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world

 More bound to's mother, yet here he lets me prate

 Like one i' th' stocks. Thou hast never in thy life

 Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,

 When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,

 Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home

 Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,

 And spurn me back; but if it he not so,

 Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,

 That thou restrain'st from me the duty which

 To a mother's part belongs. He turns away.

 Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.

 To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride

 Than pity to our prayers. Down. An end;

 This is the last. So we will home to Rome,

 And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!

 This boy, that cannot tell what he would have

 But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,

 Does reason our petition with more strength

 Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go.

 This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;

 His wife is in Corioli, and his child

 Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch.

 I am hush'd until our city be afire,

 And then I'll speak a little.

 [He holds her by the hand, silent] CORIOLANUS. O mother, mother!

 What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,

 The gods look down, and this unnatural scene

 They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!

 You have won a happy victory to Rome;

 But for your son- believe it, O, believe it!-

 Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,

 If not most mortal to him. But let it come.

 Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,

 I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,

 Were you in my stead, would you have heard

 A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?

 AUFIDIUS. I was mov'd withal.

 CORIOLANUS. I dare be sworn you were!

 And, sir, it is no little thing to make

 Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,

 What peace you'fl make, advise me. For my part,

 I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you

 Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

 AUFIDIUS. [Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy

 honour

 At difference in thee. Out of that I'll work

 Myself a former fortune.

 CORIOLANUS. [To the ladies] Ay, by and by;

 But we will drink together; and you shall bear

 A better witness back than words, which we,

 On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.

 Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve

 To have a temple built you. All the swords

 In Italy, and her confederate arms,

 Could not have made this peace. Exeunt

 SCENE IV.

 Rome. A public place

 Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS

 MENENIUS. See you yond coign o' th' Capitol, yond cornerstone? SICINIUS. Why, what of that?

 MENENIUS. If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in't; our throats are sentenc'd, and stay upon execution.

 SICINIUS. Is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man?

 MENENIUS. There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to dragon; he has wings, he's more than a creeping thing.

 SICINIUS. He lov'd his mother dearly.

 MENENIUS. So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is finish'd with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity, and a heaven to throne in.

 SICINIUS. Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.

 MENENIUS. I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find. And all this is 'long of you.

 SICINIUS. The gods be good unto us!

 MENENIUS. No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us. When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. Sir, if you'd save your life, fly to your house. The plebeians have got your fellow tribune

 And hale him up and down; all swearing if

 The Roman ladies bring not comfort home

 They'll give him death by inches.

 Enter another MESSENGER

 SICINIUS. What's the news?

 SECOND MESSENGER. Good news, good news! The ladies have prevail'd, The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone.

 A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,

 No, not th' expulsion of the Tarquins.

 SICINIUS. Friend,

 Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain?

 SECOND MESSENGER. As certain as I know the sun is fire.

 Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?

 Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide

 As the recomforted through th' gates. Why, hark you!

 [Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together] The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,

 Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans,

 Make the sun dance. Hark you! [A shout within] MENENIUS. This is good news.

 I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia

 Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,

 A city full; of tribunes such as you,

 A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:

 This morning for ten thousand of your throats

 I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!

 [Sound still with the shouts] SICINIUS. First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next, Accept my thankfulness.

 SECOND MESSENGER. Sir, we have all

 Great cause to give great thanks.

 SICINIUS. They are near the city?

 MESSENGER. Almost at point to enter.

 SICINIUS. We'll meet them,

 And help the joy. Exeunt

 SCENE V.

 Rome. A street near the gate

 Enter two SENATORS With VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, passing over the stage, 'With other LORDS

 FIRST SENATOR. Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!

 Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,

 And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them.

 Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,

 Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;

 ALL. Welcome, ladies, welcome!

 [A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt]

 SCENE VI.

 Corioli. A public place

 Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with attendents

 AUFIDIUS. Go tell the lords o' th' city I am here;

 Deliver them this paper' having read it,

 Bid them repair to th' market-place, where I,

 Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,

 Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse

 The city ports by this hath enter'd and

 Intends t' appear before the people, hoping

 To purge himself with words. Dispatch.

 Exeunt attendants

 Enter three or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS' faction

 Most welcome!

 FIRST CONSPIRATOR. How is it with our general?

 AUFIDIUS. Even so

 As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,

 And with his charity slain.

 SECOND CONSPIRATOR. Most noble sir,

 If you do hold the same intent wherein

 You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you

 Of your great danger.

 AUFIDIUS. Sir, I cannot tell;

 We must proceed as we do find the people.

 THIRD CONSPIRATOR. The people will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either

 Makes the survivor heir of all.

 AUFIDIUS. I know it;

 And my pretext to strike at him admits

 A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd

 Mine honour for his truth; who being so heighten'd,

 He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,

 Seducing so my friends; and to this end

 He bow'd his nature, never known before

 But to be rough, unswayable, and free.

 THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutness

 When he did stand for consul, which he lost

 By lack of stoopingAUFIDIUS.

 That I would have spoken of.

 Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,

 Presented to my knife his throat. I took him;

 Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way

 In all his own desires; nay, let him choose

 Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,

 My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments

 In mine own person; holp to reap the fame

 Which he did end all his, and took some pride

 To do myself this wrong. Till, at the last,

 I seem'd his follower, not partner; and

 He wag'd me with his countenance as if

 I had been mercenary.

 FIRST CONSPIRATOR. So he did, my lord.

 The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last,

 When he had carried Rome and that we look'd

 For no less spoil than gloryAUFIDIUS.

 There was it;

 For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.

 At a few drops of women's rheum, which are

 As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour

 Of our great action; therefore shall he die,

 And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

 

                                                        [Drums and

                  trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people]

  

 

 FIRST CONSPIRATOR. Your native town you enter'd like a post, And had no welcomes home; but he returns

 Splitting the air with noise.

 SECOND CONSPIRATOR. And patient fools,

 Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear

 With giving him glory.

 THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Therefore, at your vantage,

 Ere he express himself or move the people

 With what he would say, let him feel your sword,

 Which we will second. When he lies along,

 After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury

 His reasons with his body.

 AUFIDIUS. Say no more:

 Here come the lords.

 Enter the LORDS of the city

 LORDS. You are most welcome home.

 AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it.

 But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused

 What I have written to you?

 LORDS. We have.

 FIRST LORD. And grieve to hear't.

 What faults he made before the last, I think

 Might have found easy fines; but there to end

 Where he was to begin, and give away

 The benefit of our levies, answering us

 With our own charge, making a treaty where

 There was a yielding- this admits no excuse.

 AUFIDIUS. He approaches; you shall hear him.

 

              Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours;

                        the commoners being with him

  

 

 CORIOLANUS. Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier;

 No more infected with my country's love

 Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting

 Under your great command. You are to know

 That prosperously I have attempted, and

 With bloody passage led your wars even to

 The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home

 Doth more than counterpoise a full third part

 The charges of the action. We have made peace

 With no less honour to the Antiates

 Than shame to th' Romans; and we here deliver,

 Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians,

 Together with the seal o' th' Senate, what

 We have compounded on.

 AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords;

 But tell the traitor in the highest degree

 He hath abus'd your powers.

 CORIOLANUS. Traitor! How now?

 AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius.

 CORIOLANUS. Marcius!

 AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think

 I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name

 Coriolanus, in Corioli?

 You lords and heads o' th' state, perfidiously

 He has betray'd your business and given up,

 For certain drops of salt, your city RomeI

 say your city- to his wife and mother;

 Breaking his oath and resolution like

 A twist of rotten silk; never admitting

 Counsel o' th' war; but at his nurse's tears

 He whin'd and roar'd away your victory,

 That pages blush'd at him, and men of heart

 Look'd wond'ring each at others.

 CORIOLANUS. Hear'st thou, Mars?

 AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of tearsCORIOLANUS.

 Ha!

 AUFIDIUS. -no more.

 CORIOLANUS. Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart

 Too great for what contains it. 'Boy'! O slave!

 Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever

 I was forc'd to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,

 Must give this cur the lie; and his own notionWho

 wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that

 Must bear my beating to his grave- shall join

 To thrust the lie unto him.

 FIRST LORD. Peace, both, and hear me speak.

 CORIOLANUS. Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,

 Stain all your edges on me. 'Boy'! False hound!

 If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there

 That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I

 Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli.

 Alone I did it. 'Boy'!

 AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords,

 Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,

 Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,

 Fore your own eyes and ears?

 CONSPIRATORS. Let him die for't.

 ALL THE PEOPLE. Tear him to pieces. Do it presently. He kill'd my son. My daughter. He kill'd my cousin Marcus. He kill'd my father.

 SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! No outrage- peace!

 The man is noble, and his fame folds in

 This orb o' th' earth. His last offences to us

 Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,

 And trouble not the peace.

 CORIOLANUS. O that I had him,

 With six Aufidiuses, or more- his tribe,

 To use my lawful sword!

 AUFIDIUS. Insolent villain!

 CONSPIRATORS. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

 [The CONSPIRATORS draw and kill CORIOLANUS,who falls.

 AUFIDIUS stands on him] LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold!

 AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak.

 FIRST LORD. O Tullus!

 SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep. THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;

 Put up your swords.

 AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know- as in this rage, Provok'd by him, you cannot- the great danger

 Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice

 That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours

 To call me to your Senate, I'll deliver

 Myself your loyal servant, or endure

 Your heaviest censure.

 FIRST LORD. Bear from hence his body,

 And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded

 As the most noble corse that ever herald

 Did follow to his um.

 SECOND LORD. His own impatience

 Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.

 Let's make the best of it.

 AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone,

 And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.

 Help, three o' th' chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.

 Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully;

 Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he

 Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,

 Which to this hour bewail the injury,

 Yet he shall have a noble memory.

 

      Assist.               Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS

                                            [A dead march sounded]

 SCENE:

 Britain; Italy

 ACT I. SCENE I.

 Britain. The garden of CYMBELINE'S palace

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods No more obey the heavens than our courtiers

 Still seem as does the King's.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what's the matter?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom He purpos'd to his wife's sole son- a widow

 That late he married- hath referr'd herself

 Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded;

 Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd. All

 Is outward sorrow, though I think the King

 Be touch'd at very heart.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. None but the King?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen, That most desir'd the match. But not a courtier,

 Although they wear their faces to the bent

 Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not

 Glad at the thing they scowl at.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. And why so?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing Too bad for bad report; and he that hath herI

 mean that married her, alack, good man!

 And therefore banish'd- is a creature such

 As, to seek through the regions of the earth

 For one his like, there would be something failing

 In him that should compare. I do not think

 So fair an outward and such stuff within

 Endows a man but he.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. You speak him far.

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. I do extend him, sir, within himself;

 Crush him together rather than unfold

 His measure duly.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. What's his name and birth?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. I cannot delve him to the root; his father Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour

 Against the Romans with Cassibelan,

 But had his titles by Tenantius, whom

 He serv'd with glory and admir'd success,

 So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;

 And had, besides this gentleman in question,

 Two other sons, who, in the wars o' th' time,

 Died with their swords in hand; for which their father, Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow

 That he quit being; and his gentle lady,

 Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas'd

 As he was born. The King he takes the babe

 To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,

 Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,

 Puts to him all the learnings that his time

 Could make him the receiver of; which he took,

 As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red,

 And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in courtWhich

 rare it is to do- most prais'd, most lov'd,

 A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature

 A glass that feated them; and to the graver

 A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,

 For whom he now is banish'd- her own price

 Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;

 By her election may be truly read

 What kind of man he is.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. I honour him

 Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,

 Is she sole child to th' King?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. His only child.

 He had two sons- if this be worth your hearing,

 Mark it- the eldest of them at three years old,

 I' th' swathing clothes the other, from their nursery

 Were stol'n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge

 Which way they went.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. How long is this ago?

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. Some twenty years.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. That a king's children should be so convey'd, So slackly guarded, and the search so slow

 That could not trace them!

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. Howsoe'er 'tis strange,

 Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,

 Yet is it true, sir.

 SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do well believe you.

 FIRST GENTLEMAN. We must forbear; here comes the gentleman, The Queen, and Princess. Exeunt

 Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS, and IMOGEN

 QUEEN. No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,

 After the slander of most stepmothers,

 Evil-ey'd unto you. You're my prisoner, but

 Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys

 That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,

 So soon as I can win th' offended King,

 I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet

 The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good

 You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience

 Your wisdom may inform you.

 POSTHUMUS. Please your Highness,

 I will from hence to-day.

 QUEEN. You know the peril.

 I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying

 The pangs of barr'd affections, though the King

 Hath charg'd you should not speak together. Exit IMOGEN. O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant

 Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,

 I something fear my father's wrath, but nothingAlways

 reserv'd my holy duty- what

 His rage can do on me. You must be gone;

 And I shall here abide the hourly shot

 Of angry eyes, not comforted to live

 But that there is this jewel in the world

 That I may see again.

 POSTHUMUS. My queen! my mistress!

 O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause

 To be suspected of more tenderness

 Than doth become a man. I will remain

 The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth;

 My residence in Rome at one Philario's,

 Who to my father was a friend, to me

 Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,

 And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,

 Though ink be made of gall.

 Re-enter QUEEN

 QUEEN. Be brief, I pray you.

 If the King come, I shall incur I know not

 How much of his displeasure. [Aside] Yet I'll move him

 To walk this way. I never do him wrong

 But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;

 Pays dear for my offences. Exit POSTHUMUS. Should we be taking leave

 As long a term as yet we have to live,

 The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

 IMOGEN. Nay, stay a little.

 Were you but riding forth to air yourself,

 Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:

 This diamond was my mother's; take it, heart;

 But keep it till you woo another wife,

 When Imogen is dead.

 POSTHUMUS. How, how? Another?

 You gentle gods, give me but this I have,

 And sear up my embracements from a next

 With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here

 [Puts on the ring] While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,

 As I my poor self did exchange for you,

 To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles

 I still win of you. For my sake wear this;

 It is a manacle of love; I'll place it

 Upon this fairest prisoner. [Puts a bracelet on her arm] IMOGEN. O the gods!

 When shall we see again?

 Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS

 POSTHUMUS. Alack, the King!

 CYMBELINE. Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight

 If after this command thou fraught the court

 With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!

 Thou'rt poison to my blood.

 POSTHUMUS. The gods protect you,

 And bless the good remainders of the court!

 I am gone. Exit IMOGEN. There cannot be a pinch in death

 More sharp than this is.

 CYMBELINE. O disloyal thing,

 That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st

 A year's age on me!

 IMOGEN. I beseech you, sir,

 Harm not yourself with your vexation.

 I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare

 Subdues all pangs, all fears.

 CYMBELINE. Past grace? obedience?

 IMOGEN. Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace.

 CYMBELINE. That mightst have had the sole son of my queen! IMOGEN. O blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle,

 And did avoid a puttock.

 CYMBELINE. Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne A seat for baseness.

 IMOGEN. No; I rather added

 A lustre to it.

 CYMBELINE. O thou vile one!

 IMOGEN. Sir,

 It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus.

 You bred him as my playfellow, and he is

 A man worth any woman; overbuys me

 Almost the sum he pays.

 CYMBELINE. What, art thou mad?

 IMOGEN. Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were

 A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus

 Our neighbour shepherd's son!

 Re-enter QUEEN

 CYMBELINE. Thou foolish thing!

 [To the QUEEN] They were again together. You have done

 Not after our command. Away with her,

 And pen her up.

 QUEEN. Beseech your patience.- Peace,

 Dear lady daughter, peace!- Sweet sovereign,

 Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort

 Out of your best advice.

 CYMBELINE. Nay, let her languish

 A drop of blood a day and, being aged,

 Die of this folly. Exit, with LORDS

 Enter PISANIO

 QUEEN. Fie! you must give way.

 Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

 PISANIO. My lord your son drew on my master.

 QUEEN. Ha!

 No harm, I trust, is done?

 PISANIO. There might have been,

 But that my master rather play'd than fought,

 And had no help of anger; they were parted

 By gentlemen at hand.

 QUEEN. I am very glad on't.

 IMOGEN. Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part

 To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!

 I would they were in Afric both together;

 Myself by with a needle, that I might prick

 The goer-back. Why came you from your master?

 PISANIO. On his command. He would not suffer me

 To bring him to the haven; left these notes

 Of what commands I should be subject to,

 When't pleas'd you to employ me.

 QUEEN. This hath been

 Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour

 He will remain so.

 PISANIO. I humbly thank your Highness.

 QUEEN. Pray walk awhile.

 IMOGEN. About some half-hour hence,

 Pray you speak with me. You shall at least

 Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Britain. A public place

 Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS

 FIRST LORD. Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent. CLOTEN. If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him? SECOND LORD. [Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience. FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back side the town.

 CLOTEN. The villain would not stand me.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

 FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he added to your having, gave you some ground.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.

 Puppies!

 CLOTEN. I would they had not come between us.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a fool you were upon the ground.

 CLOTEN. And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me! SECOND LORD. [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn'd.

 FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.

 CLOTEN. Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.

 CLOTEN. You'll go with us?

 FIRST LORD. I'll attend your lordship.

 CLOTEN. Nay, come, let's go together.

 SECOND LORD. Well, my lord. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace

 Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO

 IMOGEN. I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven, And questioned'st every sail; if he should write,

 And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,

 As offer'd mercy is. What was the last

 That he spake to thee?

 PISANIO. It was: his queen, his queen!

 IMOGEN. Then wav'd his handkerchief?

 PISANIO. And kiss'd it, madam.

 IMOGEN. Senseless linen, happier therein than I!

 And that was all?

 PISANIO. No, madam; for so long

 As he could make me with his eye, or care

 Distinguish him from others, he did keep

 The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,

 Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind

 Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,

 How swift his ship.

 IMOGEN. Thou shouldst have made him

 As little as a crow, or less, ere left

 To after-eye him.

 PISANIO. Madam, so I did.

 IMOGEN. I would have broke mine eyestrings, crack'd them but To look upon him, till the diminution

 Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;

 Nay, followed him till he had melted from

 The smallness of a gnat to air, and then

 Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,

 When shall we hear from him?

 PISANIO. Be assur'd, madam,

 With his next vantage.

 IMOGEN. I did not take my leave of him, but had

 Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him

 How I would think on him at certain hours

 Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear

 The shes of Italy should not betray

 Mine interest and his honour; or have charg'd him,

 At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,

 T' encounter me with orisons, for then

 I am in heaven for him; or ere I could

 Give him that parting kiss which I had set

 Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,

 And like the tyrannous breathing of the north

 Shakes all our buds from growing.

 Enter a LADY

 LADY. The Queen, madam,

 Desires your Highness' company.

 IMOGEN. Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.

 I will attend the Queen.

 PISANIO. Madam, I shall. Exeunt

 SCENE IV.

 Rome. PHILARIO'S house

 Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a FRENCHMAN, a DUTCHMAN, and a SPANIARD

 IACHIMO. Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of. But I could then have look'd on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by items.

 PHILARIO. You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.

 FRENCHMAN. I have seen him in France; we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.

 IACHIMO. This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

 FRENCHMAN. And then his banishment.

 IACHIMO. Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?

 PHILARIO. His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life.

 Enter POSTHUMUS

 Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.

 FRENCHMAN. Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

 POSTHUMUS. Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.

 FRENCHMAN. Sir, you o'errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.

 POSTHUMUS. By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller; rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences; but upon my mended judgment- if I offend not to say it is mended- my quarrel was not altogether slight.

 FRENCHMAN. Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall'n both.

 IACHIMO. Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference? FRENCHMAN. Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France. IACHIMO. That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion, by this, worn out.

 POSTHUMUS. She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.

 IACHIMO. You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy. POSTHUMUS. Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend. IACHIMO. As fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comparisonhad been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain. If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excelled many; but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.

 POSTHUMUS. I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my stone. IACHIMO. What do you esteem it at?

 POSTHUMUS. More than the world enjoys.

 IACHIMO. Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead, or she's outpriz'd by a trifle.

 POSTHUMUS. You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods. IACHIMO. Which the gods have given you?

 POSTHUMUS. Which by their graces I will keep.

 IACHIMO. You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol'n too. So your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish'd courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last. POSTHUMUS. Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.

 PHILARIO. Let us leave here, gentlemen.

 POSTHUMUS. Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first. IACHIMO. With five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.

 POSTHUMUS. No, no.

 IACHIMO. I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and, to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.

 POSTHUMUS. You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt. IACHIMO. What's that?

 POSTHUMUS. A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more- a punishment too.

 PHILARIO. Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted. IACHIMO. Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th' approbation of what I have spoke!

 POSTHUMUS. What lady would you choose to assail?

 IACHIMO. Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd.

 POSTHUMUS. I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.

 IACHIMO. You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear. POSTHUMUS. This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.

 IACHIMO. I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's spoken, I swear.

 POSTHUMUS. Will you? I Shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between's. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here's my ring.

 PHILARIO. I will have it no lay.

 IACHIMO. By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yoursprovided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment. POSTHUMUS. I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate; if she remain unseduc'd, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword.

 IACHIMO. Your hand- a covenant! We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.

 POSTHUMUS. Agreed. Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO FRENCHMAN. Will this hold, think you?

 PHILARIO. Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow 'em.

 Exeunt

 SCENE V.

 Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace

 Enter QUEEN, LADIES, and CORNELIUS

 QUEEN. Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers; Make haste; who has the note of them?

 LADY. I, madam.

 QUEEN. Dispatch. Exeunt LADIES Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?

 CORNELIUS. Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.

 [Presenting a box] But I beseech your Grace, without offenceMy

 conscience bids me ask- wherefore you have

 Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds

 Which are the movers of a languishing death,

 But, though slow, deadly?

 QUEEN. I wonder, Doctor,

 Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been

 Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how

 To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so

 That our great king himself doth woo me oft

 For my confections? Having thus far proceededUnless

 thou think'st me devilish- is't not meet

 That I did amplify my judgment in

 Other conclusions? I will try the forces

 Of these thy compounds on such creatures as

 We count not worth the hanging- but none humanTo

 try the vigour of them, and apply

 Allayments to their act, and by them gather

 Their several virtues and effects.

 CORNELIUS. Your Highness

 Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;

 Besides, the seeing these effects will be

 Both noisome and infectious.

 QUEEN. O, content thee.

 Enter PISANIO

 [Aside] Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him

 Will I first work. He's for his master,

 An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio!

 Doctor, your service for this time is ended;

 Take your own way.

 CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do suspect you, madam;

 But you shall do no harm.

 QUEEN. [To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.

 CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her spirit,

 And will not trust one of her malice with

 A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has

 Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,

 Which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs,

 Then afterward up higher; but there is

 No danger in what show of death it makes,

 More than the locking up the spirits a time,

 To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd

 With a most false effect; and I the truer

 So to be false with her.

 QUEEN. No further service, Doctor,

 Until I send for thee.

 CORNELIUS. I humbly take my leave. Exit QUEEN. Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time She will not quench, and let instructions enter

 Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.

 When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,

 I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then

 As great as is thy master; greater, for

 His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name

 Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor

 Continue where he is. To shift his being

 Is to exchange one misery with another,

 And every day that comes comes comes to

 A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect

 To be depender on a thing that leans,

 Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends

 So much as but to prop him?

 [The QUEEN drops the box. PISANIO takes it up] Thou tak'st up

 Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour.

 It is a thing I made, which hath the King

 Five times redeem'd from death. I do not know

 What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;

 It is an earnest of a further good

 That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how

 The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.

 Think what a chance thou changest on; but think

 Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,

 Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King

 To any shape of thy preferment, such

 As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,

 That set thee on to this desert, am bound

 To load thy merit richly. Call my women.

 Think on my words. Exit PISANIO A sly and constant knave,

 Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,

 And the remembrancer of her to hold

 The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that

 Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her

 Of leigers for her sweet; and which she after,

 Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd

 To taste of too.

 Re-enter PISANIO and LADIES

 So, so. Well done, well done.

 The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,

 Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;

 Think on my words. Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES PISANIO. And shall do.

 But when to my good lord I prove untrue

 I'll choke myself- there's all I'll do for you. Exit

 SCENE VI.

 Britain. The palace

 Enter IMOGEN alone

 IMOGEN. A father cruel and a step-dame false;

 A foolish suitor to a wedded lady

 That hath her husband banish'd. O, that husband!

 My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated

 Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,

 As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable

 Is the desire that's glorious. Blessed be those,

 How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,

 Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

 Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO

 PISANIO. Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome

 Comes from my lord with letters.

 IACHIMO. Change you, madam?

 The worthy Leonatus is in safety,

 And greets your Highness dearly. [Presents a letter] IMOGEN. Thanks, good sir.

 You're kindly welcome.

 IACHIMO. [Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich! If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,

 She is alone th' Arabian bird, and I

 Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!

 Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!

 Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;

 Rather, directly fly.

 IMOGEN. [Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose

 kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him

 accordingly, as you value your trust. LEONATUS.'

 So far I read aloud;

 But even the very middle of my heart

 Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankfully.

 You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I

 Have words to bid you; and shall find it so

 In all that I can do.

 IACHIMO. Thanks, fairest lady.

 What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes

 To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop

 Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt

 The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones

 Upon the number'd beach, and can we not

 Partition make with spectacles so precious

 'Twixt fair and foul?

 IMOGEN. What makes your admiration?

 IACHIMO. It cannot be i' th' eye, for apes and monkeys,

 'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and

 Contemn with mows the other; nor i' th' judgment,

 For idiots in this case of favour would

 Be wisely definite; nor i' th' appetite;

 Sluttery, to such neat excellence oppos'd,

 Should make desire vomit emptiness,

 Not so allur'd to feed.

 IMOGEN. What is the matter, trow?

 IACHIMO. The cloyed willThat

 satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub

 Both fill'd and running- ravening first the lamb,

 Longs after for the garbage.

 IMOGEN. What, dear sir,

 Thus raps you? Are you well?

 IACHIMO. Thanks, madam; well.- Beseech you, sir,

 Desire my man's abode where I did leave him.

 He's strange and peevish.

 PISANIO. I was going, sir,

 To give him welcome. Exit IMOGEN. Continues well my lord? His health beseech you?

 IACHIMO. Well, madam.

 IMOGEN. Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.

 IACHIMO. Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there

 So merry and so gamesome. He is call'd

 The Britain reveller.

 IMOGEN. When he was here

 He did incline to sadness, and oft-times

 Not knowing why.

 IACHIMO. I never saw him sad.

 There is a Frenchman his companion, one

 An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves

 A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces

 The thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly BritonYour

 lord, I mean- laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,

 Can my sides hold, to think that man- who knows

 By history, report, or his own proof,

 What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose

 But must be- will's free hours languish for

 Assured bondage?'

 IMOGEN. Will my lord say so?

 IACHIMO. Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter. It is a recreation to be by

 And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know

 Some men are much to blame.

 IMOGEN. Not he, I hope.

 IACHIMO. Not he; but yet heaven's bounty towards him might Be us'd more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;

 In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.

 Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound

 To pity too.

 IMOGEN. What do you pity, sir?

 IACHIMO. Two creatures heartily.

 IMOGEN. Am I one, sir?

 You look on me: what wreck discern you in me

 Deserves your pity?

 IACHIMO. Lamentable! What,

 To hide me from the radiant sun and solace

 I' th' dungeon by a snuff?

 IMOGEN. I pray you, sir,

 Deliver with more openness your answers

 To my demands. Why do you pity me?

 IACHIMO. That others do,

 I was about to say, enjoy your- But

 It is an office of the gods to venge it,

 Not mine to speak on't.

 IMOGEN. You do seem to know

 Something of me, or what concerns me; pray youSince

 doubting things go ill often hurts more

 Than to be sure they do; for certainties

 Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,

 The remedy then born- discover to me

 What both you spur and stop.

 IACHIMO. Had I this cheek

 To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,

 Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul

 To th' oath of loyalty; this object, which

 Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,

 Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,

 Slaver with lips as common as the stairs

 That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands

 Made hard with hourly falsehood- falsehood as

 With labour; then by-peeping in an eye

 Base and illustrious as the smoky light

 That's fed with stinking tallow- it were fit

 That all the plagues of hell should at one time

 Encounter such revolt.

 IMOGEN. My lord, I fear,

 Has forgot Britain.

 IACHIMO. And himself. Not I

 Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce

 The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces

 That from my mutest conscience to my tongue

 Charms this report out.

 IMOGEN. Let me hear no more.

 IACHIMO. O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart

 With pity that doth make me sick! A lady

 So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,

 Would make the great'st king double, to be partner'd

 With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition

 Which your own coffers yield! with diseas'd ventures

 That play with all infirmities for gold

 Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff

 As well might poison poison! Be reveng'd;

 Or she that bore you was no queen, and you

 Recoil from your great stock.

 IMOGEN. Reveng'd?

 How should I be reveng'd? If this be trueAs

 I have such a heart that both mine ears

 Must not in haste abuse- if it be true,

 How should I be reveng'd?

 IACHIMO. Should he make me

 Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,

 Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,

 In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.

 I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,

 More noble than that runagate to your bed,

 And will continue fast to your affection,

 Still close as sure.

 IMOGEN. What ho, Pisanio!

 IACHIMO. Let me my service tender on your lips.

 IMOGEN. Away! I do condemn mine ears that have

 So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,

 Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not

 For such an end thou seek'st, as base as strange.

 Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far

 From thy report as thou from honour; and

 Solicits here a lady that disdains

 Thee and the devil alike.- What ho, Pisanio!-

 The King my father shall be made acquainted

 Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit

 A saucy stranger in his court to mart

 As in a Romish stew, and to expound

 His beastly mind to us, he hath a court

 He little cares for, and a daughter who

 He not respects at all.- What ho, Pisanio!

 IACHIMO. O happy Leonatus! I may say

 The credit that thy lady hath of thee

 Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness

 Her assur'd credit. Blessed live you long,

 A lady to the worthiest sir that ever

 Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only

 For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.

 I have spoke this to know if your affiance

 Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord

 That which he is new o'er; and he is one

 The truest manner'd, such a holy witch

 That he enchants societies into him,

 Half all men's hearts are his.

 IMOGEN. You make amends.

 IACHIMO. He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:

 He hath a kind of honour sets him of

 More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,

 Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur'd

 To try your taking of a false report, which hath

 Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment

 In the election of a sir so rare,

 Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him

 Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,

 Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.

 IMOGEN. All's well, sir; take my pow'r i' th' court for yours. IACHIMO. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot

 T' entreat your Grace but in a small request,

 And yet of moment too, for it concerns

 Your lord; myself and other noble friends

 Are partners in the business.

 IMOGEN. Pray what is't?

 IACHIMO. Some dozen Romans of us, and your lordThe

 best feather of our wing- have mingled sums

 To buy a present for the Emperor;

 Which I, the factor for the rest, have done

 In France. 'Tis plate of rare device, and jewels

 Of rich and exquisite form, their values great;

 And I am something curious, being strange,

 To have them in safe stowage. May it please you

 To take them in protection?

 IMOGEN. Willingly;

 And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since

 My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them

 In my bedchamber.

 IACHIMO. They are in a trunk,

 Attended by my men. I will make bold

 To send them to you only for this night;

 I must aboard to-morrow.

 IMOGEN. O, no, no.

 IACHIMO. Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word

 By length'ning my return. From Gallia

 I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise

 To see your Grace.

 IMOGEN. I thank you for your pains.

 But not away to-morrow!

 IACHIMO. O, I must, madam.

 Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please

 To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night.

 I have outstood my time, which is material

 'To th' tender of our present.

 IMOGEN. I will write.

 Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept

 And truly yielded you. You're very welcome. Exeunt

 ACT II. SCENE I.

 Britain. Before CYMBELINE'S palace

 Enter CLOTEN and the two LORDS

 CLOTEN. Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine oaths of him, and might not spend them at my pleasure.

 FIRST LORD. What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have run all out.

 CLOTEN. When a gentleman is dispos'd to swear, it is not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths. Ha?

 SECOND LORD. No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them. CLOTEN. Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been one of my rank!

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] To have smell'd like a fool.

 CLOTEN. I am not vex'd more at anything in th' earth. A pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me, because of the Queen my mother. Every jackslave hath his bellyful of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody can match.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow, cock, with your comb on.

 CLOTEN. Sayest thou?

 SECOND LORD. It is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you give offence to.

 CLOTEN. No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to my inferiors.

 SECOND LORD. Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

 CLOTEN. Why, so I say.

 FIRST LORD. Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?

 CLOTEN. A stranger, and I not known on't?

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.

 FIRST LORD. There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of Leonatus' friends.

 CLOTEN. Leonatus? A banish'd rascal; and he's another, whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?

 FIRST LORD. One of your lordship's pages.

 CLOTEN. Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in't?

 SECOND LORD. You cannot derogate, my lord.

 CLOTEN. Not easily, I think.

 SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

 CLOTEN. Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.

 SECOND LORD. I'll attend your lordship.

 Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD That such a crafty devil as is his mother

 Should yield the world this ass! A woman that

 Bears all down with her brain; and this her son

 Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,

 And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,

 Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,

 Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,

 A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer

 More hateful than the foul expulsion is

 Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act

 Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm

 The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd

 That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand

 T' enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land! Exit

 SCENE II.

 Britain. IMOGEN'S bedchamber in CYMBELINE'S palace; a trunk in one corner

 Enter IMOGEN in her bed, and a LADY attending

 IMOGEN. Who's there? My woman? Helen?

 LADY. Please you, madam.

 IMOGEN. What hour is it?

 LADY. Almost midnight, madam.

 IMOGEN. I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak; Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.

 Take not away the taper, leave it burning;

 And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,

 I prithee call me. Sleep hath seiz'd me wholly. Exit LADY To your protection I commend me, gods.

 From fairies and the tempters of the night

 Guard me, beseech ye!

 [Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk] IACHIMO. The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus

 Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd

 The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,

 How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! fresh lily,

 And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!

 But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,

 How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that

 Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' th' taper

 Bows toward her and would under-peep her lids

 To see th' enclosed lights, now canopied

 Under these windows white and azure, lac'd

 With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design

 To note the chamber. I will write all down:

 Such and such pictures; there the window; such

 Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figuresWhy,

 such and such; and the contents o' th' story.

 Ah, but some natural notes about her body

 Above ten thousand meaner movables

 Would testify, t' enrich mine inventory.

 O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!

 And be her sense but as a monument,

 Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;

 [Taking off her bracelet] As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!

 'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,

 As strongly as the conscience does within,

 To th' madding of her lord. On her left breast

 A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops

 I' th' bottom of a cowslip. Here's a voucher

 Stronger than ever law could make; this secret

 Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en

 The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?

 Why should I write this down that's riveted,

 Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late

 The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down

 Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.

 To th' trunk again, and shut the spring of it.

 Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning

 May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;

 Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here. [Clock strikes] One, two, three. Time, time! Exit into the trunk

 SCENE III.

 CYMBELINE'S palace. An ante-chamber adjoining IMOGEN'S apartments

 Enter CLOTEN and LORDS

 FIRST LORD. Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turn'd up ace.

 CLOTEN. It would make any man cold to lose.

 FIRST LORD. But not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win. CLOTEN. Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It's almost morning, is't not?

 FIRST LORD. Day, my lord.

 CLOTEN. I would this music would come. I am advised to give her music a mornings; they say it will penetrate.

 Enter musicians

 Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so. We'll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er. First, a very excellent good-conceited thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to it- and then let her consider.

 SONG

 Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,

 And Phoebus 'gins arise,

 His steeds to water at those springs

 On chalic'd flow'rs that lies;

 And winking Mary-buds begin

 To ope their golden eyes.

 With everything that pretty bin,

 My lady sweet, arise;

 Arise, arise!

 So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which horsehairs and calves' guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can never amend. Exeunt musicians

 Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN

 SECOND LORD. Here comes the King.

 CLOTEN. I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.- Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother. CYMBELINE. Attend you here the door of our stern daughter? Will she not forth?

 CLOTEN. I have assail'd her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice.

 CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is too new;

 She hath not yet forgot him; some more time

 Must wear the print of his remembrance out,

 And then she's yours.

 QUEEN. You are most bound to th' King,

 Who lets go by no vantages that may

 Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself

 To orderly soliciting, and be friended

 With aptness of the season; make denials

 Increase your services; so seem as if

 You were inspir'd to do those duties which

 You tender to her; that you in all obey her,

 Save when command to your dismission tends,

 And therein you are senseless.

 CLOTEN. Senseless? Not so.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;

 The one is Caius Lucius.

 CYMBELINE. A worthy fellow,

 Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;

 But that's no fault of his. We must receive him

 According to the honour of his sender;

 And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,

 We must extend our notice. Our dear son,

 When you have given good morning to your mistress,

 Attend the Queen and us; we shall have need

 T' employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.

 Exeunt all but CLOTEN CLOTEN. If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,

 Let her lie still and dream. By your leave, ho! [Knocks] I know her women are about her; what

 If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold

 Which buys admittance; oft it doth-yea, and makes

 Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up

 Their deer to th' stand o' th' stealer; and 'tis gold

 Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;

 Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What

 Can it not do and undo? I will make

 One of her women lawyer to me, for

 I yet not understand the case myself.

 By your leave. [Knocks]

 Enter a LADY

 LADY. Who's there that knocks?

 CLOTEN. A gentleman.

 LADY. No more?

 CLOTEN. Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.

 LADY. That's more

 Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours

 Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?

 CLOTEN. Your lady's person; is she ready?

 LADY. Ay,

 To keep her chamber.

 CLOTEN. There is gold for you; sell me your good report.

 LADY. How? My good name? or to report of you

 What I shall think is good? The Princess!

 Enter IMOGEN

 CLOTEN. Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.

 Exit LADY IMOGEN. Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains

 For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give

 Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,

 And scarce can spare them.

 CLOTEN. Still I swear I love you.

 IMOGEN. If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me.

 If you swear still, your recompense is still

 That I regard it not.

 CLOTEN. This is no answer.

 IMOGEN. But that you shall not say I yield, being silent, I would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith,

 I shall unfold equal discourtesy

 To your best kindness; one of your great knowing

 Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

 CLOTEN. To leave you in your madness 'twere my sin;

 I will not.

 IMOGEN. Fools are not mad folks.

 CLOTEN. Do you call me fool?

 IMOGEN. As I am mad, I do;

 If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;

 That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,

 You put me to forget a lady's manners

 By being so verbal; and learn now, for all,

 That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,

 By th' very truth of it, I care not for you,

 And am so near the lack of charity

 To accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather

 You felt than make't my boast.

 CLOTEN. You sin against

 Obedience, which you owe your father. For

 The contract you pretend with that base wretch,

 One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,

 With scraps o' th' court- it is no contract, none.

 And though it be allowed in meaner partiesYet

 who than he more mean?- to knit their soulsOn

 whom there is no more dependency

 But brats and beggary- in self-figur'd knot,

 Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by

 The consequence o' th' crown, and must not foil

 The precious note of it with a base slave,

 A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,

 A pantler- not so eminent!

 IMOGEN. Profane fellow!

 Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more

 But what thou art besides, thou wert too base

 To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,

 Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made

 Comparative for your virtues to be styl'd

 The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated

 For being preferr'd so well.

 CLOTEN. The south fog rot him!

 IMOGEN. He never can meet more mischance than come

 To be but nam'd of thee. His mean'st garment

 That ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer

 In my respect than all the hairs above thee,

 Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!

 Enter PISANIO

 CLOTEN. 'His garments'! Now the devilIMOGEN.

 To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.

 CLOTEN. 'His garment'!

 IMOGEN. I am sprited with a fool;

 Frighted, and ang'red worse. Go bid my woman

 Search for a jewel that too casually

 Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's; shrew me,

 If I would lose it for a revenue

 Of any king's in Europe! I do think

 I saw't this morning; confident I am

 Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it.

 I hope it be not gone to tell my lord

 That I kiss aught but he.

 PISANIO. 'Twill not be lost.

 IMOGEN. I hope so. Go and search. Exit PISANIO CLOTEN. You have abus'd me.

 'His meanest garment'!

 IMOGEN. Ay, I said so, sir.

 If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.

 CLOTEN. I will inform your father.

 IMOGEN. Your mother too.

 She's my good lady and will conceive, I hope,

 But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,

 To th' worst of discontent. Exit CLOTEN. I'll be reveng'd.

 'His mean'st garment'! Well. Exit

 SCENE IV.

 Rome. PHILARIO'S house

 Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO

 POSTHUMUS. Fear it not, sir; I would I were so sure

 To win the King as I am bold her honour

 Will remain hers.

 PHILARIO. What means do you make to him?

 POSTHUMUS. Not any; but abide the change of time,

 Quake in the present winter's state, and wish

 That warmer days would come. In these fear'd hopes

 I barely gratify your love; they failing,

 I must die much your debtor.

 PHILARIO. Your very goodness and your company

 O'erpays all I can do. By this your king

 Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius

 Will do's commission throughly; and I think

 He'll grant the tribute, send th' arrearages,

 Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance

 Is yet fresh in their grief.

 POSTHUMUS. I do believe

 Statist though I am none, nor like to be,

 That this will prove a war; and you shall hear

 The legions now in Gallia sooner landed

 In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings

 Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen

 Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar

 Smil'd at their lack of skill, but found their courage

 Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,

 Now mingled with their courages, will make known

 To their approvers they are people such

 That mend upon the world.

 Enter IACHIMO

 PHILARIO. See! Iachimo!

 POSTHUMUS. The swiftest harts have posted you by land,

 And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,

 To make your vessel nimble.

 PHILARIO. Welcome, sir.

 POSTHUMUS. I hope the briefness of your answer made

 The speediness of your return.

 IACHIMO. Your lady

 Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.

 POSTHUMUS. And therewithal the best; or let her beauty

 Look through a casement to allure false hearts,

 And be false with them.

 IACHIMO. Here are letters for you.

 POSTHUMUS. Their tenour good, I trust.

 IACHIMO. 'Tis very like.

 PHILARIO. Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court

 When you were there?

 IACHIMO. He was expected then,

 But not approach'd.

 POSTHUMUS. All is well yet.

 Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is't not

 Too dull for your good wearing?

 IACHIMO. If I have lost it,

 I should have lost the worth of it in gold.

 I'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy

 A second night of such sweet shortness which

 Was mine in Britain; for the ring is won.

 POSTHUMUS. The stone's too hard to come by.

 IACHIMO. Not a whit,

 Your lady being so easy.

 POSTHUMUS. Make not, sir,

 Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we

 Must not continue friends.

 IACHIMO. Good sir, we must,

 If you keep covenant. Had I not brought

 The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant

 We were to question farther; but I now

 Profess myself the winner of her honour,

 Together with your ring; and not the wronger

 Of her or you, having proceeded but

 By both your wills.

 POSTHUMUS. If you can make't apparent

 That you have tasted her in bed, my hand

 And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion

 You had of her pure honour gains or loses

 Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both

 To who shall find them.

 IACHIMO. Sir, my circumstances,

 Being so near the truth as I will make them,

 Must first induce you to believe- whose strength

 I will confirm with oath; which I doubt not

 You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find

 You need it not.

 POSTHUMUS. Proceed.

 IACHIMO. First, her bedchamber,

 Where I confess I slept not, but profess

 Had that was well worth watching-it was hang'd

 With tapestry of silk and silver; the story,

 Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman

 And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for

 The press of boats or pride. A piece of work

 So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive

 In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd

 Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,

 Since the true life on't wasPOSTHUMUS.

 This is true;

 And this you might have heard of here, by me

 Or by some other.

 IACHIMO. More particulars

 Must justify my knowledge.

 POSTHUMUS. So they must,

 Or do your honour injury.

 IACHIMO. The chimney

 Is south the chamber, and the chimneypiece

 Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures

 So likely to report themselves. The cutter

 Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,

 Motion and breath left out.

 POSTHUMUS. This is a thing

 Which you might from relation likewise reap,

 Being, as it is, much spoke of.

 IACHIMO. The roof o' th' chamber

 With golden cherubins is fretted; her andironsI

 had forgot them- were two winking Cupids

 Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely

 Depending on their brands.

 POSTHUMUS. This is her honour!

 Let it be granted you have seen all this, and praise

 Be given to your remembrance; the description

 Of what is in her chamber nothing saves

 The wager you have laid.

 IACHIMO. Then, if you can, [Shows the bracelet] Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. See!

 And now 'tis up again. It must be married

 To that your diamond; I'll keep them.

 POSTHUMUS. Jove!

 Once more let me behold it. Is it that

 Which I left with her?

 IACHIMO. Sir- I thank her- that.

 She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;

 Her pretty action did outsell her gift,

 And yet enrich'd it too. She gave it me, and said

 She priz'd it once.

 POSTHUMUS. May be she pluck'd it of

 To send it me.

 IACHIMO. She writes so to you, doth she?

 POSTHUMUS. O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;

 [Gives the ring] It is a basilisk unto mine eye,

 Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour

 Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love

 Where there's another man. The vows of women

 Of no more bondage be to where they are made

 Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.

 O, above measure false!

 PHILARIO. Have patience, sir,

 And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.

 It may be probable she lost it, or

 Who knows if one her women, being corrupted

 Hath stol'n it from her?

 POSTHUMUS. Very true;

 And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring.

 Render to me some corporal sign about her,

 More evident than this; for this was stol'n.

 IACHIMO. By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!

 POSTHUMUS. Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.

 'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure

 She would not lose it. Her attendants are

 All sworn and honourable- they induc'd to steal it!

 And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.

 The cognizance of her incontinency

 Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly. There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell

 Divide themselves between you!

 PHILARIO. Sir, be patient;

 This is not strong enough to be believ'd

 Of one persuaded well of.

 POSTHUMUS. Never talk on't;

 She hath been colted by him.

 IACHIMO. If you seek

 For further satisfying, under her breastWorthy

 the pressing- lies a mole, right proud

 Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,

 I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger

 To feed again, though full. You do remember

 This stain upon her?

 POSTHUMUS. Ay, and it doth confirm

 Another stain, as big as hell can hold,

 Were there no more but it.

 IACHIMO. Will you hear more?

 POSTHUMUS. Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns.

 Once, and a million!

 IACHIMO. I'll be swornPOSTHUMUS.

 No swearing.

 If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;

 And I will kill thee if thou dost deny

 Thou'st made me cuckold.

 IACHIMO. I'll deny nothing.

 POSTHUMUS. O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!

 I will go there and do't, i' th' court, before

 Her father. I'll do something- Exit PHILARIO. Quite besides

 The government of patience! You have won.

 Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath

 He hath against himself.

 IACHIMO. With all my heart. Exeunt

 SCENE V.

 Rome. Another room in PHILARIO'S house

 Enter POSTHUMUS

 POSTHUMUS. Is there no way for men to be, but women

 Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,

 And that most venerable man which I

 Did call my father was I know not where

 When I was stamp'd. Some coiner with his tools

 Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem'd

 The Dian of that time. So doth my wife

 The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!

 Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd,

 And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with

 A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't

 Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her

 As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!

 This yellow Iachimo in an hour- was't not?

 Or less!- at first? Perchance he spoke not, but,

 Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,

 Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition

 But what he look'd for should oppose and she

 Should from encounter guard. Could I find out

 The woman's part in me! For there's no motion

 That tends to vice in man but I affirm

 It is the woman's part. Be it lying, note it,

 The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;

 Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;

 Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,

 Nice longing, slanders, mutability,

 All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,

 Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all;

 For even to vice

 They are not constant, but are changing still

 One vice but of a minute old for one

 Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,

 Detest them, curse them. Yet 'tis greater skill

 In a true hate to pray they have their will:

 The very devils cannot plague them better. Exit

 ACT III. SCENE I.

 Britain. A hall in CYMBELINE'S palace

 Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, and LORDS at one door, and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and attendants

 CYMBELINE. Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

 LUCIUS. When Julius Caesar- whose remembrance yet

 Lives in men's eyes, and will to ears and tongues

 Be theme and hearing ever- was in this Britain,

 And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,

 Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less

 Than in his feats deserving it, for him

 And his succession granted Rome a tribute,

 Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately

 Is left untender'd.

 QUEEN. And, to kill the marvel,

 Shall be so ever.

 CLOTEN. There be many Caesars

 Ere such another Julius. Britain is

 A world by itself, and we will nothing pay

 For wearing our own noses.

 QUEEN. That opportunity,

 Which then they had to take from 's, to resume

 We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,

 The kings your ancestors, together with

 The natural bravery of your isle, which stands

 As Neptune's park, ribb'd and pal'd in

 With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,

 With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats

 But suck them up to th' top-mast. A kind of conquest

 Caesar made here; but made not here his brag

 Of 'came, and saw, and overcame.' With shameThe

 first that ever touch'd him- he was carried

 From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shippingPoor

 ignorant baubles!- on our terrible seas,

 Like egg-shells mov'd upon their surges, crack'd

 As easily 'gainst our rocks; for joy whereof

 The fam'd Cassibelan, who was once at pointO,

 giglot fortune!- to master Caesar's sword,

 Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright

 And Britons strut with courage.

 CLOTEN. Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no moe such Caesars. Other of them may have crook'd noses; but to owe such straight arms, none.

 CYMBELINE. Son, let your mother end.

 CLOTEN. We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

 CYMBELINE. You must know,

 Till the injurious Romans did extort

 This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar's ambitionWhich

 swell'd so much that it did almost stretch

 The sides o' th' world- against all colour here

 Did put the yoke upon's; which to shake of

 Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon

 Ourselves to be.

 CLOTEN. We do.

 CYMBELINE. Say then to Caesar,

 Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which

 Ordain'd our laws- whose use the sword of Caesar

 Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise

 Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,

 Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws, Who was the first of Britain which did put

 His brows within a golden crown, and call'd

 Himself a king.

 LUCIUS. I am sorry, Cymbeline,

 That I am to pronounce Augustus CaesarCaesar,

 that hath moe kings his servants than

 Thyself domestic officers- thine enemy.

 Receive it from me, then: war and confusion

 In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee; look

 For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,

 I thank thee for myself.

 CYMBELINE. Thou art welcome, Caius.

 Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent

 Much under him; of him I gather'd honour,

 Which he to seek of me again, perforce,

 Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect

 That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for

 Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent

 Which not to read would show the Britons cold;

 So Caesar shall not find them.

 LUCIUS. Let proof speak.

 CLOTEN. His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and there's an end.

 LUCIUS. So, sir.

 CYMBELINE. I know your master's pleasure, and he mine;

 All the remain is, welcome. Exeunt

 SCENE II.

 Britain. Another room in CYMBELINE'S palace

 Enter PISANIO reading of a letter

 PISANIO. How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not

 What monsters her accuse? Leonatus!

 O master, what a strange infection

 Is fall'n into thy ear! What false ItalianAs

 poisonous-tongu'd as handed- hath prevail'd

 On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.

 She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,

 More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults

 As would take in some virtue. O my master!

 Thy mind to her is now as low as were

 Thy fortunes. How? that I should murder her?

 Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I

 Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?

 If it be so to do good service, never

 Let me be counted serviceable. How look I

 That I should seem to lack humanity

 So much as this fact comes to? [Reads] 'Do't. The letter That I have sent her, by her own command

 Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper,

 Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,

 Art thou a fedary for this act, and look'st

 So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.

 Enter IMOGEN

 I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

 IMOGEN. How now, Pisanio!

 PISANIO. Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

 IMOGEN. Who? thy lord? That is my lord- Leonatus?

 O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer

 That knew the stars as I his charactersHe'

 d lay the future open. You good gods,

 Let what is here contain'd relish of love,

 Of my lord's health, of his content; yet not

 That we two are asunder- let that grieve him!

 Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,

 For it doth physic love- of his content,

 All but in that. Good wax, thy leave. Blest be

 You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers

 And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;

 Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet

 You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!

 [Reads] 'Justice and your father's wrath, should he take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love

 LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'

 O for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?

 He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me

 How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs

 May plod it in a week, why may not I

 Glide thither in a day? Then, true PisanioWho

 long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'stO,

 let me 'bate!- but not like me, yet long'st,

 But in a fainter kind- O, not like me,

 For mine's beyond beyond!-say, and speak thickLove'

 s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing

 To th' smothering of the sense- how far it is

 To this same blessed Milford. And by th' way

 Tell me how Wales was made so happy as

 T' inherit such a haven. But first of all,

 How we may steal from hence; and for the gap

 That we shall make in time from our hence-going

 And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.

 Why should excuse be born or ere begot?

 We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,

 How many score of miles may we well ride

 'Twixt hour and hour?

 PISANIO. One score 'twixt sun and sun,

 Madam, 's enough for you, and too much too.

 IMOGEN. Why, one that rode to's execution, man,

 Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers

 Where horses have been nimbler than the sands

 That run i' th' clock's behalf. But this is fool'ry.

 Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say

 She'll home to her father; and provide me presently

 A riding suit, no costlier than would fit

 A franklin's huswife.

 PISANIO. Madam, you're best consider.

 IMOGEN. I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,

 Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them

 That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;

 Do as I bid thee. There's no more to say;

 Accessible is none but Milford way. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Wales. A mountainous country with a cave

 Enter from the cave BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

 BELARIUS. A goodly day not to keep house with such

 Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate

 Instructs you how t' adore the heavens, and bows you

 To a morning's holy office. The gates of monarchs

 Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through

 And keep their impious turbans on without

 Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!

 We house i' th' rock, yet use thee not so hardly

 As prouder livers do.

 GUIDERIUS. Hail, heaven!

 ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!

 BELARIUS. Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,

 Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,

 When you above perceive me like a crow,

 That it is place which lessens and sets off;

 And you may then revolve what tales I have told you

 Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.

 This service is not service so being done,

 But being so allow'd. To apprehend thus

 Draws us a profit from all things we see,

 And often to our comfort shall we find

 The sharded beetle in a safer hold

 Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life

 Is nobler than attending for a check,

 Richer than doing nothing for a bribe,

 Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:

 Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine,

 Yet keeps his book uncross'd. No life to ours!

 GUIDERIUS. Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg'd, Have never wing'd from view o' th' nest, nor know not

 What air's from home. Haply this life is best,

 If quiet life be best; sweeter to you

 That have a sharper known; well corresponding

 With your stiff age. But unto us it is

 A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,

 A prison for a debtor that not dares

 To stride a limit.

 ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of

 When we are old as you? When we shall hear

 The rain and wind beat dark December, how,

 In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse.

 The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;

 We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,

 Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.

 Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage

 We make a choir, as doth the prison'd bird,

 And sing our bondage freely.

 BELARIUS. How you speak!

 Did you but know the city's usuries,

 And felt them knowingly- the art o' th' court,

 As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb

 Is certain falling, or so slipp'ry that

 The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' th' war,

 A pain that only seems to seek out danger

 I' th'name of fame and honour, which dies i' th'search, And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph

 As record of fair act; nay, many times,

 Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worseMust

 curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story

 The world may read in me; my body's mark'd

 With Roman swords, and my report was once

 first with the best of note. Cymbeline lov'd me;

 And when a soldier was the theme, my name

 Was not far off. Then was I as a tree

 Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night

 A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,

 Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,

 And left me bare to weather.

 GUIDERIUS. Uncertain favour!

 BELARIUS. My fault being nothing- as I have told you oftBut that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd

 Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline

 I was confederate with the Romans. So

 Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years

 This rock and these demesnes have been my world,

 Where I have liv'd at honest freedom, paid

 More pious debts to heaven than in all

 The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains!

 This is not hunters' language. He that strikes

 The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast;

 To him the other two shall minister;

 And we will fear no poison, which attends

 In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.

 Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!

 These boys know little they are sons to th' King,

 Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.

 They think they are mine; and though train'd up thus meanly I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit

 The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them

 In simple and low things to prince it much

 Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,

 The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who

 The King his father call'd Guiderius- Jove!

 When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell

 The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out

 Into my story; say 'Thus mine enemy fell,

 And thus I set my foot on's neck'; even then

 The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,

 Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture

 That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,

 Once Arviragus, in as like a figure

 Strikes life into my speech, and shows much more

 His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous'd!

 O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows

 Thou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon,

 At three and two years old, I stole these babes,

 Thinking to bar thee of succession as

 Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,

 Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother, And every day do honour to her grave.

 Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,

 They take for natural father. The game is up. Exit

 SCENE IV.

 Wales, near Milford Haven

 Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN

 IMOGEN. Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place Was near at hand. Ne'er long'd my mother so

 To see me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man!

 Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind

 That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh

 From th' inward of thee? One but painted thus

 Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd

 Beyond self-explication. Put thyself

 Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness

 Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?

 Why tender'st thou that paper to me with

 A look untender! If't be summer news,

 Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st

 But keep that count'nance still. My husband's hand?

 That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,

 And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue

 May take off some extremity, which to read

 Would be even mortal to me.

 PISANIO. Please you read,

 And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing

 The most disdain'd of fortune.

 IMOGEN. [Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play'd the strumpet in my bed, the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art the pander to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal.' PISANIO. What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper

 Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,

 Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue

 Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath

 Rides on the posting winds and doth belie

 All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,

 Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,

 This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?

 IMOGEN. False to his bed? What is it to be false?

 To lie in watch there, and to think on him?

 To weep twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,

 To break it with a fearful dream of him,

 And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed,

 Is it?

 PISANIO. Alas, good lady!

 IMOGEN. I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,

 Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;

 Thou then look'dst like a villain; now, methinks,

 Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy,

 Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him.

 Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,

 And for I am richer than to hang by th' walls

 I must be ripp'd. To pieces with me! O,

 Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,

 By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought

 Put on for villainy; not born where't grows,

 But worn a bait for ladies.

 PISANIO. Good madam, hear me.

 IMOGEN. True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,

 Were, in his time, thought false; and Sinon's weeping

 Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity

 From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,

 Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men:

 Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd

 From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest;

 Do thou thy master's bidding; when thou seest him,

 A little witness my obedience. Look!

 I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit

 The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.

 Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;

 Thy master is not there, who was indeed

 The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.

 Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,

 But now thou seem'st a coward.

 PISANIO. Hence, vile instrument!

 Thou shalt not damn my hand.

 IMOGEN. Why, I must die;

 And if I do not by thy hand, thou art

 No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter

 There is a prohibition so divine

 That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heartSomething'

 s afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence!-

 Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?

 The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus

 All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,

 Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more

 Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools

 Believe false teachers; though those that are betray'd

 Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor

 Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,

 That didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the King

 My father, and make me put into contempt the suits

 Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find

 It is no act of common passage but

 A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself

 To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her

 That now thou tirest on, how thy memory

 Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee dispatch.

 The lamp entreats the butcher. Where's thy knife?

 Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,

 When I desire it too.

 PISANIO. O gracious lady,

 Since I receiv'd command to do this busines

 I have not slept one wink.

 IMOGEN. Do't, and to bed then.

 PISANIO. I'll wake mine eyeballs first.

 IMOGEN. Wherefore then

 Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abus'd

 So many miles with a pretence? This place?

 Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?

 The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,

 For my being absent?- whereunto I never

 Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far

 To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,

 Th' elected deer before thee?

 PISANIO. But to win time

 To lose so bad employment, in the which

 I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,

 Hear me with patience.

 IMOGEN. Talk thy tongue weary- speak.

 I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,

 Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,

 Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.

 PISANIO. Then, madam,

 I thought you would not back again.

 IMOGEN. Most likeBringing

 me here to kill me.

 PISANIO. Not so, neither;

 But if I were as wise as honest, then

 My purpose would prove well. It cannot be

 But that my master is abus'd. Some villain,

 Ay, and singular in his art, hath done you both

 This cursed injury.

 IMOGEN. Some Roman courtezan!

 PISANIO. No, on my life!

 I'll give but notice you are dead, and send him

 Some bloody sign of it, for 'tis commanded

 I should do so. You shall be miss'd at court,

 And that will well confirm it.

 IMOGEN. Why, good fellow,

 What shall I do the while? where bide? how live?

 Or in my life what comfort, when I am

 Dead to my husband?

 PISANIO. If you'll back to th' courtIMOGEN.

 No court, no father, nor no more ado

 With that harsh, noble, simple nothingThat

 Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me

 As fearful as a siege.

 PISANIO. If not at court,

 Then not in Britain must you bide.

 IMOGEN. Where then?

 Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,

 Are they not but in Britain? I' th' world's volume

 Our Britain seems as of it, but not in't;

 In a great pool a swan's nest. Prithee think

 There's livers out of Britain.

 PISANIO. I am most glad

 You think of other place. Th' ambassador,

 LUCIUS the Roman, comes to Milford Haven

 To-morrow. Now, if you could wear a mind

 Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise

 That which t' appear itself must not yet be

 But by self-danger, you should tread a course

 Pretty and full of view; yea, happily, near

 The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,

 That though his actions were not visible, yet

 Report should render him hourly to your ear

 As truly as he moves.

 IMOGEN. O! for such means,

 Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,

 I would adventure.

 PISANIO. Well then, here's the point:

 You must forget to be a woman; change

 Command into obedience; fear and nicenessThe

 handmaids of all women, or, more truly,

 Woman it pretty self- into a waggish courage;

 Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy, and

 As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must

 Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,

 Exposing it- but, O, the harder heart!

 Alack, no remedy!- to the greedy touch

 Of common-kissing Titan, and forget

 Your laboursome and dainty trims wherein

 You made great Juno angry.

 IMOGEN. Nay, be brief;

 I see into thy end, and am almost

 A man already.

 PISANIO. First, make yourself but like one.

 Fore-thinking this, I have already fit-

 'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all

 That answer to them. Would you, in their serving,

 And with what imitation you can borrow

 From youth of such a season, fore noble Lucius

 Present yourself, desire his service, tell him

 Wherein you're happy- which will make him know

 If that his head have ear in music; doubtless

 With joy he will embrace you; for he's honourable,

 And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroadYou

 have me, rich; and I will never fail

 Beginning nor supplyment.

 IMOGEN. Thou art all the comfort

 The gods will diet me with. Prithee away!

 There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even

 All that good time will give us. This attempt

 I am soldier to, and will abide it with

 A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.

 PISANIO. Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,

 Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of

 Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,

 Here is a box; I had it from the Queen.

 What's in't is precious. If you are sick at sea

 Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this

 Will drive away distemper. To some shade,

 And fit you to your manhood. May the gods

 Direct you to the best!

 IMOGEN. Amen. I thank thee. Exeunt severally

 SCENE V.

 Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace

 Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, and LORDS

 CYMBELINE. Thus far; and so farewell.

 LUCIUS. Thanks, royal sir.

 My emperor hath wrote; I must from hence,

 And am right sorry that I must report ye

 My master's enemy.

 CYMBELINE. Our subjects, sir,

 Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself

 To show less sovereignty than they, must needs

 Appear unkinglike.

 LUCIUS. So, sir. I desire of you

 A conduct overland to Milford Haven.

 Madam, all joy befall your Grace, and you!

 CYMBELINE. My lords, you are appointed for that office;

 The due of honour in no point omit.

 So farewell, noble Lucius.

 LUCIUS. Your hand, my lord.

 CLOTEN. Receive it friendly; but from this time forth

 I wear it as your enemy.

 LUCIUS. Sir, the event

 Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.

 CYMBELINE. Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,

 Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!

 Exeunt LUCIUS and LORDS QUEEN. He goes hence frowning; but it honours us

 That we have given him cause.

 CLOTEN. 'Tis all the better;

 Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

 CYMBELINE. Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor

 How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely

 Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.

 The pow'rs that he already hath in Gallia

 Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves

 His war for Britain.

 QUEEN. 'Tis not sleepy business,

 But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.

 CYMBELINE. Our expectation that it would be thus

 Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,

 Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd

 Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd

 The duty of the day. She looks us like

 A thing more made of malice than of duty;

 We have noted it. Call her before us, for

 We have been too slight in sufferance. Exit a MESSENGER QUEEN. Royal sir,

 Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd

 Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,

 'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,

 Forbear sharp speeches to her; she's a lady

 So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,

 And strokes death to her.

 Re-enter MESSENGER

 CYMBELINE. Where is she, sir? How

 Can her contempt be answer'd?

 MESSENGER. Please you, sir,

 Her chambers are all lock'd, and there's no answer

 That will be given to th' loud of noise we make.

 QUEEN. My lord, when last I went to visit her,

 She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close;

 Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity

 She should that duty leave unpaid to you

 Which daily she was bound to proffer. This

 She wish'd me to make known; but our great court

 Made me to blame in memory.

 CYMBELINE. Her doors lock'd?

 Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear

 Prove false! Exit QUEEN. Son, I say, follow the King.

 CLOTEN. That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,

 I have not seen these two days.

 QUEEN. Go, look after. Exit CLOTEN Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!

 He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence

 Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes

 It is a thing most precious. But for her,

 Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz'd her;

 Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown

 To her desir'd Posthumus. Gone she is

 To death or to dishonour, and my end

 Can make good use of either. She being down,

 I have the placing of the British crown.

 Re-enter CLOTEN

 How now, my son?

 CLOTEN. 'Tis certain she is fled.

 Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none

 Dare come about him.

 QUEEN. All the better. May

 This night forestall him of the coming day! Exit CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,

 And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite

 Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one

 The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,

 Outsells them all. I love her therefore; but

 Disdaining me and throwing favours on

 The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment

 That what's else rare is chok'd; and in that point

 I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,

 To be reveng'd upon her. For when fools

 Shall-

 Enter PISANIO

 Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?

 Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,

 Where is thy lady? In a word, or else

 Thou art straightway with the fiends.

 PISANIO. O good my lord!

 CLOTEN. Where is thy lady? or, by JupiterI

 will not ask again. Close villain,

 I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip

 Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?

 From whose so many weights of baseness cannot

 A dram of worth be drawn.

 PISANIO. Alas, my lord,

 How can she be with him? When was she miss'd?

 He is in Rome.

 CLOTEN. Where is she, sir? Come nearer.

 No farther halting! Satisfy me home

 What is become of her.

 PISANIO. O my all-worthy lord!

 CLOTEN. All-worthy villain!

 Discover where thy mistress is at once,

 At the next word. No more of 'worthy lord'!

 Speak, or thy silence on the instant is

 Thy condemnation and thy death.

 PISANIO. Then, sir,

 This paper is the history of my knowledge

 Touching her flight. [Presenting a letter] CLOTEN. Let's see't. I will pursue her

 Even to Augustus' throne.

 PISANIO. [Aside] Or this or perish.

 She's far enough; and what he learns by this

 May prove his travel, not her danger.

 CLOTEN. Humh!

 PISANIO. [Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen, Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

 CLOTEN. Sirrah, is this letter true?

 PISANIO. Sir, as I think.

 CLOTEN. It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry- that is, what villainy soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it directly and truly- I would think thee an honest man; thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment.

 PISANIO. Well, my good lord.

 CLOTEN. Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou serve me?

 PISANIO. Sir, I will.

 CLOTEN. Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession?

 PISANIO. I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.

 CLOTEN. The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let it be thy first service; go.

 PISANIO. I shall, my lord. Exit CLOTEN. Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing; I'll remember't anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a time- the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart- that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valour, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dinedwhich, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so prais'd- to the court I'll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath despis'd me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my revenge.

 Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes

 Be those the garments?

 PISANIO. Ay, my noble lord.

 CLOTEN. How long is't since she went to Milford Haven?

 PISANIO. She can scarce be there yet.

 CLOTEN. Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous and true, preferment shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford, would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true. Exit PISANIO. Thou bid'st me to my loss; for true to thee

 Were to prove false, which I will never be,

 To him that is most true. To Milford go,

 And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,

 You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed

 Be cross'd with slowness! Labour be his meed! Exit

 SCENE VI.

 Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS

 Enter IMOGEN alone, in boy's clothes

 IMOGEN. I see a man's life is a tedious one.

 I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together

 Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick

 But that my resolution helps me. Milford,

 When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,

 Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think

 Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,

 Where they should be reliev'd. Two beggars told me

 I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,

 That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis

 A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,

 When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness

 Is sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood

 Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!

 Thou art one o' th' false ones. Now I think on thee

 My hunger's gone; but even before, I was

 At point to sink for food. But what is this?

 Here is a path to't; 'tis some savage hold.

 I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine,

 Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.

 Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever

 Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?

 If anything that's civil, speak; if savage,

 Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.

 Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy

 But fear the sword, like me, he'll scarcely look on't.

 Such a foe, good heavens! Exit into the cave

 Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

 BELARIUS. You, Polydore, have prov'd best woodman and

 Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I

 Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match.

 The sweat of industry would dry and die

 But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs

 Will make what's homely savoury; weariness

 Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth

 Finds the down pillow hard. Now, peace be here,

 Poor house, that keep'st thyself!

 GUIDERIUS. I am thoroughly weary.

 ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.

 GUIDERIUS. There is cold meat i' th' cave; we'll browse on that Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.

 BELARIUS. [Looking into the cave] Stay, come not in.

 But that it eats our victuals, I should think

 Here were a fairy.

 GUIDERIUS. What's the matter, sir?

 BELARIUS.. By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,

 An earthly paragon! Behold divineness

 No elder than a boy!

 Re-enter IMOGEN

 IMOGEN. Good masters, harm me not.

 Before I enter'd here I call'd, and thought

 To have begg'd or bought what I have took. Good troth,

 I have stol'n nought; nor would not though I had found

 Gold strew'd i' th' floor. Here's money for my meat.

 I would have left it on the board, so soon

 As I had made my meal, and parted

 With pray'rs for the provider.

 GUIDERIUS. Money, youth?

 ARVIRAGUS. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,

 As 'tis no better reckon'd but of those

 Who worship dirty gods.

 IMOGEN. I see you're angry.

 Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should

 Have died had I not made it.

 BELARIUS. Whither bound?

 IMOGEN. To Milford Haven.

 BELARIUS. What's your name?

 IMOGEN. Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who

 Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;

 To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,

 I am fall'n in this offence.

 BELARIUS. Prithee, fair youth,

 Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds

 By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!

 'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer

 Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.

 Boys, bid him welcome.

 GUIDERIUS. Were you a woman, youth,

 I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty

 I bid for you as I'd buy.

 ARVIRAGUS. I'll make't my comfort

 He is a man. I'll love him as my brother;

 And such a welcome as I'd give to him

 After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome!

 Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.

 IMOGEN. 'Mongst friends,

 If brothers. [Aside] Would it had been so that they

 Had been my father's sons! Then had my prize

 Been less, and so more equal ballasting

 To thee, Posthumus.

 BELARIUS. He wrings at some distress.

 GUIDERIUS. Would I could free't!

 ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be,

 What pain it cost, what danger! Gods!

 BELARIUS. [Whispering] Hark, boys.

 IMOGEN. [Aside] Great men,

 That had a court no bigger than this cave,

 That did attend themselves, and had the virtue

 Which their own conscience seal'd them, laying by

 That nothing-gift of differing multitudes,

 Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!

 I'd change my sex to be companion with them,

 Since Leonatus' false.

 BELARIUS. It shall be so.

 Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in.

 Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,

 We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,

 So far as thou wilt speak it.

 GUIDERIUS. Pray draw near.

 ARVIRAGUS. The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome. IMOGEN. Thanks, sir.

 ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near. Exeunt

 SCENE VII.

 Rome. A public place

 Enter two ROMAN SENATORS and TRIBUNES

 FIRST SENATOR. This is the tenour of the Emperor's writ:

 That since the common men are now in action

 'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,

 And that the legions now in Gallia are

 Full weak to undertake our wars against

 The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite

 The gentry to this business. He creates

 Lucius proconsul; and to you, the tribunes,

 For this immediate levy, he commands

 His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!

 TRIBUNE. Is Lucius general of the forces?

 SECOND SENATOR. Ay.

 TRIBUNE. Remaining now in Gallia?

 FIRST SENATOR. With those legions

 Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy

 Must be supplyant. The words of your commission

 Will tie you to the numbers and the time

 Of their dispatch.

 TRIBUNE. We will discharge our duty. Exeunt

 ACT IV. SCENE I.

 Wales. Near the cave of BELARIUS

 Enter CLOTEN alone

 CLOTEN. I am near to th' place where they should meet, if Pisanio have mapp'd it truly. How fit his garments serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit too? The rather- saving reverence of the word- for 'tis said a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber- I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before her face; and all this done, spurn her home to her father, who may, haply, be a little angry for my so rough usage; but my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the very description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not deceive me. Exit

 SCENE II.

 Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS

 Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN

 BELARIUS. [To IMOGEN] You are not well. Remain here in the cave; We'll come to you after hunting.

 ARVIRAGUS. [To IMOGEN] Brother, stay here.

 Are we not brothers?

 IMOGEN. So man and man should be;

 But clay and clay differs in dignity,

 Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

 GUIDERIUS. Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

 IMOGEN. So sick I am not, yet I am not well;

 But not so citizen a wanton as

 To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me;

 Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom

 Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me

 Cannot amend me; society is no comfort

 To one not sociable. I am not very sick,

 Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here.

 I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,

 Stealing so poorly.

 GUIDERIUS. I love thee; I have spoke it.

 How much the quantity, the weight as much

 As I do love my father.

 BELARIUS. What? how? how?

 ARVIRAGUS. If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me

 In my good brother's fault. I know not why

 I love this youth, and I have heard you say

 Love's reason's without reason. The bier at door,

 And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say

 'My father, not this youth.'

 BELARIUS. [Aside] O noble strain!

 O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!

 Cowards father cowards and base things sire base.

 Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.

 I'm not their father; yet who this should be

 Doth miracle itself, lov'd before me.-

 'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.

 ARVIRAGUS. Brother, farewell.

 IMOGEN. I wish ye sport.

 ARVIRAGUS. Your health. [To BELARIUS] So please you, sir. IMOGEN. [Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have

 heard!

 Our courtiers say all's savage but at court.

 Experience, O, thou disprov'st report!

 Th' imperious seas breed monsters; for the dish,

 Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.

 I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,

 I'll now taste of thy drug. [Swallows some] GUIDERIUS. I could not stir him.

 He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;

 Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

 ARVIRAGUS. Thus did he answer me; yet said hereafter

 I might know more.

 BELARIUS. To th' field, to th' field!

 We'll leave you for this time. Go in and rest.

 ARVIRAGUS. We'll not be long away.

 BELARIUS. Pray be not sick,

 For you must be our huswife.

 IMOGEN. Well, or ill,

 I am bound to you.

 BELARIUS. And shalt be ever. Exit IMOGEN into the cave This youth, howe'er distress'd, appears he hath had

 Good ancestors.

 ARVIRAGUS. How angel-like he sings!

 GUIDERIUS. But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters, And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick,

 And he her dieter.

 ARVIRAGUS. Nobly he yokes

 A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh

 Was that it was for not being such a smile;

 The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly

 From so divine a temple to commix

 With winds that sailors rail at.

 GUIDERIUS. I do note

 That grief and patience, rooted in him both,

 Mingle their spurs together.

 ARVIRAGUS. Grow patience!

 And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine

 His perishing root with the increasing vine!

 BELARIUS. It is great morning. Come, away! Who's there?

 Enter CLOTEN

 CLOTEN. I cannot find those runagates; that villain

 Hath mock'd me. I am faint.

 BELARIUS. Those runagates?

 Means he not us? I partly know him; 'tis

 Cloten, the son o' th' Queen. I fear some ambush.

 I saw him not these many years, and yet

 I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!

 GUIDERIUS. He is but one; you and my brother search

 What companies are near. Pray you away;

 Let me alone with him. Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS CLOTEN. Soft! What are you

 That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?

 I have heard of such. What slave art thou?

 GUIDERIUS. A thing

 More slavish did I ne'er than answering

 'A slave' without a knock.

 CLOTEN. Thou art a robber,

 A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.

 GUIDERIUS. To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I

 An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?

 Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not

 My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art;

 Why I should yield to thee.

 CLOTEN. Thou villain base,

 Know'st me not by my clothes?

 GUIDERIUS. No, nor thy tailor, rascal,

 Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,

 Which, as it seems, make thee.

 CLOTEN. Thou precious varlet,

 My tailor made them not.

 GUIDERIUS. Hence, then, and thank

 The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;

 I am loath to beat thee.

 CLOTEN. Thou injurious thief,

 Hear but my name, and tremble.

 GUIDERIUS. What's thy name?

 CLOTEN. Cloten, thou villain.

 GUIDERIUS. Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,

 I cannot tremble at it. Were it toad, or adder, spider, 'Twould move me sooner.

 CLOTEN. To thy further fear,

 Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know

 I am son to th' Queen.

 GUIDERIUS. I'm sorry for't; not seeming

 So worthy as thy birth.

 CLOTEN. Art not afeard?

 GUIDERIUS. Those that I reverence, those I fear- the wise: At fools I laugh, not fear them.

 CLOTEN. Die the death.

 When I have slain thee with my proper hand,

 I'll follow those that even now fled hence,

 And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads.

 Yield, rustic mountaineer. Exeunt, fighting

 Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS

 BELARIUS. No company's abroad.

 ARVIRAGUS. None in the world; you did mistake him, sure.

 BELARIUS. I cannot tell; long is it since I saw him,

 But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour

 Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,

 And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute

 'Twas very Cloten.

 ARVIRAGUS. In this place we left them.

 I wish my brother make good time with him,

 You say he is so fell.

 BELARIUS. Being scarce made up,

 I mean to man, he had not apprehension

 Or roaring terrors; for defect of judgment

 Is oft the cease of fear.

 Re-enter GUIDERIUS with CLOTEN'S head

 But, see, thy brother.

 GUIDERIUS. This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;

 There was no money in't. Not Hercules

 Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none;

 Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne

 My head as I do his.

 BELARIUS. What hast thou done?

 GUIDERIUS. I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,

 Son to the Queen, after his own report;

 Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore

 With his own single hand he'd take us in,

 Displace our heads where- thank the gods!- they grow,

 And set them on Lud's Town.

 BELARIUS. We are all undone.

 GUIDERIUS. Why, worthy father, what have we to lose

 But that he swore to take, our lives? The law

 Protects not us; then why should we be tender

 To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,

 Play judge and executioner all himself,

 For we do fear the law? What company

 Discover you abroad?

 BELARIUS. No single soul

 Can we set eye on, but in an safe reason

 He must have some attendants. Though his humour

 Was nothing but mutation- ay, and that

 From one bad thing to worse- not frenzy, not

 Absolute madness could so far have rav'd,

 To bring him here alone. Although perhaps

 It may be heard at court that such as we

 Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time

 May make some stronger head- the which he hearing,

 As it is like him, might break out and swear

 He'd fetch us in; yet is't not probable

 To come alone, either he so undertaking

 Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,

 If we do fear this body hath a tail

 More perilous than the head.

 ARVIRAGUS. Let ordinance

 Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er,

 My brother hath done well.

 BELARIUS. I had no mind

 To hunt this day; the boy Fidele's sickness

 Did make my way long forth.

 GUIDERIUS. With his own sword,

 Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en

 His head from him. I'll throw't into the creek

 Behind our rock, and let it to the sea

 And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten.

 That's all I reck. Exit BELARIUS. I fear'twill be reveng'd.

 Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done't! though valour

 Becomes thee well enough.

 ARVIRAGUS. Would I had done't,

 So the revenge alone pursu'd me! Polydore,

 I love thee brotherly, but envy much

 Thou hast robb'd me of this deed. I would revenges,

 That possible strength might meet, would seek us through, And put us to our answer.

 BELARIUS. Well, 'tis done.

 We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger

 Where there's no profit. I prithee to our rock.

 You and Fidele play the cooks; I'll stay

 Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him

 To dinner presently.

 ARVIRAGUS. Poor sick Fidele!

 I'll willingly to him; to gain his colour

 I'd let a parish of such Cloten's blood,

 And praise myself for charity. Exit BELARIUS. O thou goddess,

 Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon'st

 In these two princely boys! They are as gentle

 As zephyrs blowing below the violet,

 Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,

 Their royal blood enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind

 That by the top doth take the mountain pine

 And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder

 That an invisible instinct should frame them

 To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,

 Civility not seen from other, valour

 That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop

 As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange

 What Cloten's being here to us portends,

 Or what his death will bring us.

 Re-enter GUIDERIUS

 GUIDERIUS. Where's my brother?

 I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,

 In embassy to his mother; his body's hostage

 For his return. [Solemn music] BELARIUS. My ingenious instrument!

 Hark, Polydore, it sounds. But what occasion

 Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!

 GUIDERIUS. Is he at home?

 BELARIUS. He went hence even now.

 GUIDERIUS. What does he mean? Since death of my dear'st mother It did not speak before. All solemn things

 Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?

 Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys

 Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.

 Is Cadwal mad?

 Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN as dead, bearing

 her in his arms

 BELARIUS. Look, here he comes,

 And brings the dire occasion in his arms

 Of what we blame him for!

 ARVIRAGUS. The bird is dead

 That we have made so much on. I had rather

 Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,

 To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch,

 Than have seen this.

 GUIDERIUS. O sweetest, fairest lily!

 My brother wears thee not the one half so well

 As when thou grew'st thyself.

 BELARIUS. O melancholy!

 Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find

 The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare

 Might'st easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!

 Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,

 Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.

 How found you him?

 ARVIRAGUS. Stark, as you see;

 Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,

 Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right cheek

 Reposing on a cushion.

 GUIDERIUS. Where?

 ARVIRAGUS. O' th' floor;

 His arms thus leagu'd. I thought he slept, and put

 My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness

 Answer'd my steps too loud.

 GUIDERIUS. Why, he but sleeps.

 If he be gone he'll make his grave a bed;

 With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,

 And worms will not come to thee.

 ARVIRAGUS. With fairest flowers,

 Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,

 I'll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack

 The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor

 The azur'd hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor

 The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,

 Out-sweet'ned not thy breath. The ruddock would,

 With charitable bill- O bill, sore shaming

 Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie

 Without a monument!- bring thee all this;

 Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flow'rs are none,

 To winter-ground thy corseGUIDERIUS.

 Prithee have done,

 And do not play in wench-like words with that

 Which is so serious. Let us bury him,

 And not protract with admiration what

 Is now due debt. To th' grave.

 ARVIRAGUS. Say, where shall's lay him?

 GUIDERIUS. By good Euriphile, our mother.

 ARVIRAGUS. Be't so;

 And let us, Polydore, though now our voices

 Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th' ground,

 As once to our mother; use like note and words,

 Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.

 GUIDERIUS. Cadwal,

 I cannot sing. I'll weep, and word it with thee;

 For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse

 Than priests and fanes that lie.

 ARVIRAGUS. We'll speak it, then.

 BELARIUS. Great griefs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;

 And though he came our enemy, remember

 He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rotting

 Together have one dust, yet reverenceThat

 angel of the world- doth make distinction

 Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely;

 And though you took his life, as being our foe,

 Yet bury him as a prince.

 GUIDERIUS. Pray you fetch him hither.

 Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',

 When neither are alive.

 ARVIRAGUS. If you'll go fetch him,

 We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.

 Exit BELARIUS GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East; My father hath a reason for't.

 ARVIRAGUS. 'Tis true.

 GUIDERIUS. Come on, then, and remove him.

 ARVIRAGUS. So. Begin.

 SONG

 GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the heat o' th' sun

 

                 Nor the furious winter's rages;

               Thou thy worldly task hast done,

                 Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.

               Golden lads and girls all must,

               As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

  

 

 ARVIRAGUS. Fear no more the frown o' th' great;

 

                 Thou art past the tyrant's stroke.

               Care no more to clothe and eat;

                 To thee the reed is as the oak.

               The sceptre, learning, physic, must

               All follow this and come to dust.

  

 

 GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the lightning flash,

 ARVIRAGUS. Nor th' all-dreaded thunder-stone;

 GUIDERIUS. Fear not slander, censure rash;

 ARVIRAGUS. Thou hast finish'd joy and moan.

 BOTH. All lovers young, all lovers must

 Consign to thee and come to dust.

 GUIDERIUS. No exorciser harm thee!

 ARVIRAGUS. Nor no witchcraft charm thee!

 GUIDERIUS. Ghost unlaid forbear thee!

 ARVIRAGUS. Nothing ill come near thee!

 BOTH. Quiet consummation have,

 And renowned be thy grave!

 Re-enter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN

 GUIDERIUS. We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down. BELARIUS. Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more. The herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night

 Are strewings fit'st for graves. Upon their faces.

 You were as flow'rs, now wither'd. Even so

 These herblets shall which we upon you strew.

 Come on, away. Apart upon our knees.

 The ground that gave them first has them again.

 Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.

 Exeunt all but IMOGEN IMOGEN. [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way? I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?

 'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?

 I have gone all night. Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.

 But, soft! no bedfellow. O gods and goddesses!

 [Seeing the body] These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world;

 This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;

 For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,

 And cook to honest creatures. But 'tis not so;

 'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,

 Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes

 Are sometimes, like our judgments, blind. Good faith,

 I tremble still with fear; but if there be

 Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity

 As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!

 The dream's here still. Even when I wake it is

 Without me, as within me; not imagin'd, felt.

 A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?

 I know the shape of's leg; this is his hand,

 His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,

 The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial faceMurder

 in heaven! How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio,

 All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,

 And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,

 Conspir'd with that irregulous devil, Cloten,

 Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read

 Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio

 Hath with his forged letters- damn'd PisanioFrom

 this most bravest vessel of the world

 Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas,

 Where is thy head? Where's that? Ay me! where's that?

 Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,

 And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?

 'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them

 Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!

 The drug he gave me, which he said was precious

 And cordial to me, have I not found it

 Murd'rous to th' senses? That confirms it home.

 This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten. O!

 Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,

 That we the horrider may seem to those

 Which chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!

 [Falls fainting on the body]

 Enter LUCIUS, CAPTAINS, and a SOOTHSAYER

 CAPTAIN. To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia,

 After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending

 You here at Milford Haven; with your ships,

 They are in readiness.

 LUCIUS. But what from Rome?

 CAPTAIN. The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners

 And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,

 That promise noble service; and they come

 Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,

 Sienna's brother.

 LUCIUS. When expect you them?

 CAPTAIN. With the next benefit o' th' wind.

 LUCIUS. This forwardness

 Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers

 Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,

 What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?

 SOOTHSAYER. Last night the very gods show'd me a visionI

 fast and pray'd for their intelligence- thus:

 I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd

 From the spongy south to this part of the west,

 There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends,

 Unless my sins abuse my divination,

 Success to th' Roman host.

 LUCIUS. Dream often so,

 And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here

 Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime

 It was a worthy building. How? a page?

 Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead, rather;

 For nature doth abhor to make his bed

 With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.

 Let's see the boy's face.

 CAPTAIN. He's alive, my lord.

 LUCIUS. He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,

 Inform us of thy fortunes; for it seems

 They crave to be demanded. Who is this

 Thou mak'st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he

 That, otherwise than noble nature did,

 Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest

 In this sad wreck? How came't? Who is't? What art thou? IMOGEN. I am nothing; or if not,

 Nothing to be were better. This was my master,

 A very valiant Briton and a good,

 That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!

 There is no more such masters. I may wander

 From east to occident; cry out for service;

 Try many, all good; serve truly; never

 Find such another master.

 LUCIUS. 'Lack, good youth!

 Thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than

 Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.

 IMOGEN. Richard du Champ. [Aside] If I do lie, and do

 No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope

 They'll pardon it.- Say you, sir?

 LUCIUS. Thy name?

 IMOGEN. Fidele, sir.

 LUCIUS. Thou dost approve thyself the very same;

 Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.

 Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say

 Thou shalt be so well master'd; but, be sure,

 No less belov'd. The Roman Emperor's letters,

 Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner

 Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.

 IMOGEN. I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods, I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep

 As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when

 With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave, And on it said a century of prayers,

 Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;

 And leaving so his service, follow you,

 So please you entertain me.

 LUCIUS. Ay, good youth;

 And rather father thee than master thee.

 My friends,

 The boy hath taught us manly duties; let us

 Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,

 And make him with our pikes and partisans

 A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd

 By thee to us; and he shall be interr'd

 As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.

 Some falls are means the happier to arise. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace

 Enter CYMBELINE, LORDS, PISANIO, and attendants

 CYMBELINE. Again! and bring me word how 'tis with her.

 Exit an attendant A fever with the absence of her son;

 A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,

 How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,

 The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen

 Upon a desperate bed, and in a time

 When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,

 So needful for this present. It strikes me past

 The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,

 Who needs must know of her departure and

 Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee

 By a sharp torture.

 PISANIO. Sir, my life is yours;

 I humbly set it at your will; but for my mistress,

 I nothing know where she remains, why gone,

 Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your Highness,

 Hold me your loyal servant.

 LORD. Good my liege,

 The day that she was missing he was here.

 I dare be bound he's true and shall perform

 All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,

 There wants no diligence in seeking him,

 And will no doubt be found.

 CYMBELINE. The time is troublesome.

 [To PISANIO] We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy Does yet depend.

 LORD. So please your Majesty,

 The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,

 Are landed on your coast, with a supply

 Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent.

 CYMBELINE. Now for the counsel of my son and queen!

 I am amaz'd with matter.

 LORD. Good my liege,

 Your preparation can affront no less

 Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you're ready. The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion

 That long to move.

 CYMBELINE. I thank you. Let's withdraw,

 And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not

 What can from Italy annoy us; but

 We grieve at chances here. Away! Exeunt all but PISANIO PISANIO. I heard no letter from my master since

 I wrote him Imogen was slain. 'Tis strange.

 Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise

 To yield me often tidings. Neither know

 What is betid to Cloten, but remain

 Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.

 Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.

 These present wars shall find I love my country,

 Even to the note o' th' King, or I'll fall in them.

 All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:

 Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd. Exit

 SCENE IV.

 Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS

 Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

 GUIDERIUS. The noise is round about us.

 BELARIUS. Let us from it.

 ARVIRAGUS. What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it From action and adventure?

 GUIDERIUS. Nay, what hope

 Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans

 Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us

 For barbarous and unnatural revolts

 During their use, and slay us after.

 BELARIUS. Sons,

 We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.

 To the King's party there's no going. Newness

 Of Cloten's death- we being not known, not muster'd

 Among the bands-may drive us to a render

 Where we have liv'd, and so extort from's that

 Which we have done, whose answer would be death,

 Drawn on with torture.

 GUIDERIUS. This is, sir, a doubt

 In such a time nothing becoming you

 Nor satisfying us.

 ARVIRAGUS. It is not likely

 That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,

 Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes

 And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,

 That they will waste their time upon our note,

 To know from whence we are.

 BELARIUS. O, I am known

 Of many in the army. Many years,

 Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him

 From my remembrance. And, besides, the King

 Hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves,

 Who find in my exile the want of breeding,

 The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless

 To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd,

 But to be still hot summer's tanlings and

 The shrinking slaves of winter.

 GUIDERIUS. Than be so,

 Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army.

 I and my brother are not known; yourself

 So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,

 Cannot be questioned.

 ARVIRAGUS. By this sun that shines,

 I'll thither. What thing is't that I never

 Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood

 But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!

 Never bestrid a horse, save one that had

 A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel

 Nor iron on his heel! I am asham'd

 To look upon the holy sun, to have

 The benefit of his blest beams, remaining

 So long a poor unknown.

 GUIDERIUS. By heavens, I'll go!

 If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,

 I'll take the better care; but if you will not,

 The hazard therefore due fall on me by

 The hands of Romans!

 ARVIRAGUS. So say I. Amen.

 BELARIUS. No reason I, since of your lives you set

 So slight a valuation, should reserve

 My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!

 If in your country wars you chance to die,

 That is my bed too, lads, and there I'll lie.

 Lead, lead. [Aside] The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn Till it fly out and show them princes born. Exeunt

 ACT V. SCENE I.

 Britain. The Roman camp

 Enter POSTHUMUS alone, with a bloody handkerchief

 POSTHUMUS. Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee; for I wish'd Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,

 If each of you should take this course, how many

 Must murder wives much better than themselves

 For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!

 Every good servant does not all commands;

 No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you

 Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never

 Had liv'd to put on this; so had you saved

 The noble Imogen to repent, and struck

 Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack,

 You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,

 To have them fall no more. You some permit

 To second ills with ills, each elder worse,

 And make them dread it, to the doer's thrift.

 But Imogen is your own. Do your best wills,

 And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither

 Among th' Italian gentry, and to fight

 Against my lady's kingdom. 'Tis enough

 That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!

 I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,

 Hear patiently my purpose. I'll disrobe me

 Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself

 As does a Britain peasant. So I'll fight

 Against the part I come with; so I'll die

 For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life

 Is every breath a death. And thus unknown,

 Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril

 Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know

 More valour in me than my habits show.

 Gods, put the strength o' th' Leonati in me!

 To shame the guise o' th' world, I will begin

 The fashion- less without and more within. Exit

 SCENE II.

 Britain. A field of battle between the British and Roman camps

 Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman army at one door, and the British army at another, LEONATUS POSTHUMUS following like a poor soldier. They march over and go out. Alarums. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS. He vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him

 IACHIMO. The heaviness and guilt within my bosom

 Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,

 The Princess of this country, and the air on't

 Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,

 A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me

 In my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne

 As I wear mine are titles but of scorn.

 If that thy gentry, Britain, go before

 This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds

 Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods. Exit

 The battle continues; the BRITONS fly; CYMBELINE is taken. Then enter to his rescue BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

 BELARIUS. Stand, stand! We have th' advantage of the ground; The lane is guarded; nothing routs us but

 The villainy of our fears.

 GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS. Stand, stand, and fight!

 Re-enter POSTHUMUS, and seconds the Britons; they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS and IACHIMO,

 with IMOGEN

 LUCIUS. Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;

 For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such

 As war were hoodwink'd.

 IACHIMO. 'Tis their fresh supplies.

 LUCIUS. It is a day turn'd strangely. Or betimes

 Let's reinforce or fly. Exeunt

 SCENE III.

 Another part of the field

 Enter POSTHUMUS and a Britain LORD

 LORD. Cam'st thou from where they made the stand?

 POSTHUMUS. I did:

 Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.

 LORD. I did.

 POSTHUMUS. No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,

 But that the heavens fought. The King himself

 Of his wings destitute, the army broken,

 And but the backs of Britons seen, an flying,

 Through a strait lane- the enemy, full-hearted,

 Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring, having work

 More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down

 Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling

 Merely through fear, that the strait pass was damm'd

 With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living

 To die with length'ned shame.

 LORD. Where was this lane?

 POSTHUMUS. Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf, Which gave advantage to an ancient soldierAn

 honest one, I warrant, who deserv'd

 So long a breeding as his white beard came to,

 In doing this for's country. Athwart the lane

 He, with two striplings- lads more like to run

 The country base than to commit such slaughter;

 With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer

 Than those for preservation cas'd or shameMade

 good the passage, cried to those that fled

 'Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men.

 To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards! Stand;

 Or we are Romans and will give you that,

 Like beasts, which you shun beastly, and may save

 But to look back in frown. Stand, stand!' These three,

 Three thousand confident, in act as manyFor

 three performers are the file when all

 The rest do nothing- with this word 'Stand, stand!'

 Accommodated by the place, more charming

 With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd

 A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,

 Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some turn'd coward But by example- O, a sin in war

 Damn'd in the first beginners!- gan to look

 The way that they did and to grin like lions

 Upon the pikes o' th' hunters. Then began

 A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon

 A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,

 Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,

 The strides they victors made; and now our cowards,

 Like fragments in hard voyages, became

 The life o' th' need. Having found the back-door open

 Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!

 Some slain before, some dying, some their friends

 O'erborne i' th' former wave. Ten chas'd by one

 Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty.

 Those that would die or ere resist are grown

 The mortal bugs o' th' field.

 LORD. This was strange chance:

 A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.

 POSTHUMUS. Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made

 Rather to wonder at the things you hear

 Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,

 And vent it for a mock'ry? Here is one:

 'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,

 Preserv'd the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'

 LORD. Nay, be not angry, sir.

 POSTHUMUS. 'Lack, to what end?

 Who dares not stand his foe I'll be his friend;

 For if he'll do as he is made to do,

 I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.

 You have put me into rhyme.

 LORD. Farewell; you're angry. Exit POSTHUMUS. Still going? This is a lord! O noble misery,

 To be i' th' field and ask 'What news?' of me!

 To-day how many would have given their honours

 To have sav'd their carcasses! took heel to do't,

 And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,

 Could not find death where I did hear him groan,

 Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,

 'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,

 Sweet words; or hath moe ministers than we

 That draw his knives i' th' war. Well, I will find him; For being now a favourer to the Briton,

 No more a Briton, I have resum'd again

 The part I came in. Fight I will no more,

 But yield me to the veriest hind that shall

 Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is

 Here made by th' Roman; great the answer be

 Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;

 On either side I come to spend my breath,

 Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,

 But end it by some means for Imogen.

 Enter two BRITISH CAPTAINS and soldiers

 FIRST CAPTAIN. Great Jupiter be prais'd! Lucius is taken. 'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.

 SECOND CAPTAIN. There was a fourth man, in a silly habit, That gave th' affront with them.

 FIRST CAPTAIN. So 'tis reported;

 But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?

 POSTHUMUS. A Roman,

 Who had not now been drooping here if seconds

 Had answer'd him.

 SECOND CAPTAIN. Lay hands on him; a dog!

 A leg of Rome shall not return to tell

 What crows have peck'd them here. He brags his service, As if he were of note. Bring him to th' King.

 Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, and Roman captives. The CAPTAINS present POSTHUMUS to CYMBELINE, who delivers

 him over to a gaoler. Exeunt omnes

 SCENE IV.

 Britain. A prison

 Enter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS

 FIRST GAOLER. You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you; So graze as you find pasture.

 SECOND GAOLER. Ay, or a stomach. Exeunt GAOLERS POSTHUMUS. Most welcome, bondage! for thou art a way,

 I think, to liberty. Yet am I better

 Than one that's sick o' th' gout, since he had rather

 Groan so in perpetuity than be cur'd

 By th' sure physician death, who is the key

 T' unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd

 More than my shanks and wrists; you good gods, give me

 The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,

 Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?

 So children temporal fathers do appease;

 Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,

 I cannot do it better than in gyves,

 Desir'd more than constrain'd. To satisfy,

 If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take

 No stricter render of me than my all.

 I know you are more clement than vile men,

 Who of their broken debtors take a third,

 A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again

 On their abatement; that's not my desire.

 For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though

 'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.

 'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;

 Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake;

 You rather mine, being yours. And so, great pow'rs,

 If you will take this audit, take this life,

 And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!

 I'll speak to thee in silence. [Sleeps]

 Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS

 LEONATUS, father to POSTHUMUS, an old man attired

 like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient

 matron, his WIFE, and mother to POSTHUMUS, with

 music before them. Then, after other music, follows

 the two young LEONATI, brothers to POSTHUMUS,

 with wounds, as they died in the wars.

 They circle POSTHUMUS round as he lies sleeping

 SICILIUS. No more, thou thunder-master, show

 

                Thy spite on mortal flies.

              With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,

                That thy adulteries

                  Rates and revenges.

              Hath my poor boy done aught but well,

                Whose face I never saw?

              I died whilst in the womb he stay'd

                Attending nature's law;

              Whose father then, as men report

                Thou orphans' father art,

              Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him

                From this earth-vexing smart.

  

 

 MOTHER. Lucina lent not me her aid,

 

                But took me in my throes,

              That from me was Posthumus ripp'd,

                Came crying 'mongst his foes,

                  A thing of pity.

  

 

 SICILIUS. Great Nature like his ancestry

 

                Moulded the stuff so fair

              That he deserv'd the praise o' th' world

                As great Sicilius' heir.

  

 

 FIRST BROTHER. When once he was mature for man,

 

                In Britain where was he

              That could stand up his parallel,

                Or fruitful object be

              In eye of Imogen, that best

                Could deem his dignity?

  

 

 MOTHER. With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,

 

                To be exil'd and thrown

              From Leonati seat and cast

              From her his dearest one,

                Sweet Imogen?

  

 

 SICILIUS. Why did you suffer Iachimo,

 

                Slight thing of Italy,

              To taint his nobler heart and brain

                With needless jealousy,

              And to become the geck and scorn

                O' th' other's villainy?

  

 

 SECOND BROTHER. For this from stiller seats we came,

 

                Our parents and us twain,

              That, striking in our country's cause,

                Fell bravely and were slain,

              Our fealty and Tenantius' right

                With honour to maintain.

  

 

 FIRST BROTHER. Like hardiment Posthumus hath

 

                To Cymbeline perform'd.

              Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,

                Why hast thou thus adjourn'd

              The graces for his merits due,

                Being all to dolours turn'd?

  

 

 SICILIUS. Thy crystal window ope; look out;

 

                No longer exercise

              Upon a valiant race thy harsh

                And potent injuries.

  

 

 MOTHER. Since, Jupiter, our son is good,

 Take off his miseries.

 SICILIUS. Peep through thy marble mansion. Help!

 

                Or we poor ghosts will cry

              To th' shining synod of the rest

                Against thy deity.

  

 

 BROTHERS. Help, Jupiter! or we appeal,

 And from thy justice fly.

 JUPITER descends-in thunder and lightning, sitting

 upon an eagle. He throws a thunderbolt. The GHOSTS

 fall on their knees

 JUPITER. No more, you petty spirits of region low,

 Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts

 Accuse the Thunderer whose bolt, you know,

 Sky-planted, batters all rebelling coasts?

 Poor shadows of Elysium, hence and rest

 Upon your never-withering banks of flow'rs.

 Be not with mortal accidents opprest:

 No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.

 Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,

 The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;

 Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift;

 His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.

 Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in

 Our temple was he married. Rise and fade!

 He shall be lord of Lady Imogen,

 And happier much by his affliction made.

 This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein

 Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine;

 And so, away; no farther with your din

 Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.

 Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline. [Ascends] SICILIUS. He came in thunder; his celestial breath

 Was sulpherous to smell; the holy eagle

 Stoop'd as to foot us. His ascension is

 More sweet than our blest fields. His royal bird

 Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,

 As when his god is pleas'd.

 ALL. Thanks, Jupiter!

 SICILIUS. The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd

 His radiant roof. Away! and, to be blest,

 Let us with care perform his great behest. [GHOSTS vanish]

 POSTHUMUS. [Waking] Sleep, thou has been a grandsire and begot A father to me; and thou hast created

 A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,

 Gone! They went hence so soon as they were born.

 And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend

 On greatness' favour, dream as I have done;

 Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve;

 Many dream not to find, neither deserve,

 And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,

 That have this golden chance, and know not why.

 What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!

 Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment

 Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effects

 So follow to be most unlike our courtiers,

 As good as promise.

 [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embrac'd by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'

 'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen

 Tongue, and brain not; either both or nothing,

 Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such

 As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,

 The action of my life is like it, which

 I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

 Re-enter GAOLER

 GAOLER. Come, sir, are you ready for death?

 POSTHUMUS. Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.

 GAOLER. Hanging is the word, sir; if you be ready for that, you are well cook'd.

 POSTHUMUS. So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish pays the shot.

 GAOLER. A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you shall be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern bills, which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters; so the acquittance follows.

 POSTHUMUS. I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

 GAOLER. Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache. But a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.

 POSTHUMUS. Yes indeed do I, fellow.

 GAOLER. Your death has eyes in's head, then; I have not seen him so pictur'd. You must either be directed by some that take upon them to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril. And how you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll never return to tell one.

 POSTHUMUS. I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them. GAOLER. What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER. Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King. POSTHUMUS. Thou bring'st good news: I am call'd to be made free. GAOLER. I'll be hang'd then.

 POSTHUMUS. Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead. Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MESSENGER GAOLER. Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live, for all he be a Roman; and there be some of them too that die against their wills; so should I, if I were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in't. Exit

 SCENE V.

 Britain. CYMBELINE'S tent

 Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, LORDS, OFFICERS, and attendants

 CYMBELINE. Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made

 Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart

 That the poor soldier that so richly fought,

 Whose rags sham'd gilded arms, whose naked breast

 Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found.

 He shall be happy that can find him, if

 Our grace can make him so.

 BELARIUS. I never saw

 Such noble fury in so poor a thing;

 Such precious deeds in one that promis'd nought

 But beggary and poor looks.

 CYMBELINE. No tidings of him?

 PISANIO. He hath been search'd among the dead and living, But no trace of him.

 CYMBELINE. To my grief, I am

 The heir of his reward; [To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS] which I will add

 To you, the liver, heart, and brain, of Britain,

 By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time

 To ask of whence you are. Report it.

 BELARIUS. Sir,

 In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen;

 Further to boast were neither true nor modest,

 Unless I add we are honest.

 CYMBELINE. Bow your knees.

 Arise my knights o' th' battle; I create you

 Companions to our person, and will fit you

 With dignities becoming your estates.

 Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES

 There's business in these faces. Why so sadly

 Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,

 And not o' th' court of Britain.

 CORNELIUS. Hail, great King!

 To sour your happiness I must report

 The Queen is dead.

 CYMBELINE. Who worse than a physician

 Would this report become? But I consider

 By med'cine'life may be prolong'd, yet death

 Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?

 CORNELIUS. With horror, madly dying, like her life;

 Which, being cruel to the world, concluded

 Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd

 I will report, so please you; these her women

 Can trip me if I err, who with wet cheeks

 Were present when she finish'd.

 CYMBELINE. Prithee say.

 CORNELIUS. First, she confess'd she never lov'd you; only Affected greatness got by you, not you;

 Married your royalty, was wife to your place;

 Abhorr'd your person.

 CYMBELINE. She alone knew this;

 And but she spoke it dying, I would not

 Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.

 CORNELIUS. Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love

 With such integrity, she did confess

 Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,

 But that her flight prevented it, she had

 Ta'en off by poison.

 CYMBELINE. O most delicate fiend!

 Who is't can read a woman? Is there more?

 CORNELIUS. More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had

 For you a mortal mineral, which, being took,

 Should by the minute feed on life, and ling'ring,

 By inches waste you. In which time she purpos'd,

 By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to

 O'ercome you with her show; and in time,

 When she had fitted you with her craft, to work

 Her son into th' adoption of the crown;

 But failing of her end by his strange absence,

 Grew shameless-desperate, open'd, in despite

 Of heaven and men, her purposes, repented

 The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so,

 Despairing, died.

 CYMBELINE. Heard you all this, her women?

 LADY. We did, so please your Highness.

 CYMBELINE. Mine eyes

 Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;

 Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart

 That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious

 To have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter!

 That it was folly in me thou mayst say,

 And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

 Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the SOOTHSAYER, and other

 Roman prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS behind, and IMOGEN

 Thou com'st not, Caius, now for tribute; that

 The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss

 Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit

 That their good souls may be appeas'd with slaughter

 Of you their captives, which ourself have granted;

 So think of your estate.

 LUCIUS. Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day

 Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,

 We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten'd Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods

 Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives

 May be call'd ransom, let it come. Sufficeth

 A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.

 Augustus lives to think on't; and so much

 For my peculiar care. This one thing only

 I will entreat: my boy, a Briton born,

 Let him be ransom'd. Never master had

 A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,

 So tender over his occasions, true,

 So feat, so nurse-like; let his virtue join

 With my request, which I'll make bold your Highness

 Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm

 Though he have serv'd a Roman. Save him, sir,

 And spare no blood beside.

 CYMBELINE. I have surely seen him;

 His favour is familiar to me. Boy,

 Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,

 And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore

 To say 'Live, boy.' Ne'er thank thy master. Live;

 And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,

 Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;

 Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,

 The noblest ta'en.

 IMOGEN. I humbly thank your Highness.

 LUCIUS. I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,

 And yet I know thou wilt.

 IMOGEN. No, no! Alack,

 There's other work in hand. I see a thing

 Bitter to me as death; your life, good master,

 Must shuffle for itself.

 LUCIUS. The boy disdains me,

 He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys

 That place them on the truth of girls and boys.

 Why stands he so perplex'd?

 CYMBELINE. What wouldst thou, boy?

 I love thee more and more; think more and more

 What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? Speak, Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?

 IMOGEN. He is a Roman, no more kin to me

 Than I to your Highness; who, being born your vassal,

 Am something nearer.

 CYMBELINE. Wherefore ey'st him so?

 IMOGEN. I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please

 To give me hearing.

 CYMBELINE. Ay, with all my heart,

 And lend my best attention. What's thy name?

 IMOGEN. Fidele, sir.

 CYMBELINE. Thou'rt my good youth, my page;

 I'll be thy master. Walk with me; speak freely.

 [CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart] BELARIUS. Is not this boy reviv'd from death?

 ARVIRAGUS. One sand another

 Not more resembles- that sweet rosy lad

 Who died and was Fidele. What think you?

 GUIDERIUS. The same dead thing alive.

 BELARIUS. Peace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear. Creatures may be alike; were't he, I am sure

 He would have spoke to us.

 GUIDERIUS. But we saw him dead.

 BELARIUS. Be silent; let's see further.

 PISANIO. [Aside] It is my mistress.

 Since she is living, let the time run on

 To good or bad. [CYMBELINE and IMOGEN advance] CYMBELINE. Come, stand thou by our side;

 Make thy demand aloud. [To IACHIMO] Sir, step you forth; Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,

 Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,

 Which is our honour, bitter torture shall

 Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.

 IMOGEN. My boon is that this gentleman may render

 Of whom he had this ring.

 POSTHUMUS. [Aside] What's that to him?

 CYMBELINE. That diamond upon your finger, say

 How came it yours?

 IACHIMO. Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that

 Which to be spoke would torture thee.

 CYMBELINE. How? me?

 IACHIMO. I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that

 Which torments me to conceal. By villainy

 I got this ring; 'twas Leonatus' jewel,

 Whom thou didst banish; and- which more may grieve thee, As it doth me- a nobler sir ne'er liv'd

 'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

 CYMBELINE. All that belongs to this.

 IACHIMO. That paragon, thy daughter,

 For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits

 Quail to remember- Give me leave, I faint.

 CYMBELINE. My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength;

 I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will

 Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.

 IACHIMO. Upon a time- unhappy was the clock

 That struck the hour!- was in Rome- accurs'd

 The mansion where!- 'twas at a feast- O, would

 Our viands had been poison'd, or at least

 Those which I heav'd to head!- the good PosthumusWhat

 should I say? he was too good to be

 Where ill men were, and was the best of all

 Amongst the rar'st of good ones- sitting sadly

 Hearing us praise our loves of Italy

 For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast

 Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming

 The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,

 Postures beyond brief nature; for condition,

 A shop of all the qualities that man

 Loves woman for; besides that hook of wiving,

 Fairness which strikes the eyeCYMBELINE.

 I stand on fire.

 Come to the matter.

 IACHIMO. All too soon I shall,

 Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,

 Most like a noble lord in love and one

 That had a royal lover, took his hint;

 And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein

 He was as calm as virtue- he began

 His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,

 And then a mind put in't, either our brags

 Were crack'd of kitchen trulls, or his description

 Prov'd us unspeaking sots.

 CYMBELINE. Nay, nay, to th' purpose.

 IACHIMO. Your daughter's chastity- there it begins.

 He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams

 And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,

 Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him

 Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore

 Upon his honour'd finger, to attain

 In suit the place of's bed, and win this ring

 By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,

 No lesser of her honour confident

 Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;

 And would so, had it been a carbuncle

 Of Phoebus' wheel; and might so safely, had it

 Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain

 Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,

 Remember me at court, where I was taught

 Of your chaste daughter the wide difference

 'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd

 Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain

 Gan in your duller Britain operate

 Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent;

 And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd

 That I return'd with simular proof enough

 To make the noble Leonatus mad,

 By wounding his belief in her renown

 With tokens thus and thus; averring notes

 Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her braceletO

 cunning, how I got it!- nay, some marks

 Of secret on her person, that he could not

 But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,

 I having ta'en the forfeit. WhereuponMethinks

 I see him nowPOSTHUMUS.

 [Coming forward] Ay, so thou dost,

 Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,

 Egregious murderer, thief, anything

 That's due to all the villains past, in being,

 To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,

 Some upright justicer! Thou, King, send out

 For torturers ingenious. It is I

 That all th' abhorred things o' th' earth amend

 By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,

 That kill'd thy daughter; villain-like, I lieThat

 caus'd a lesser villain than myself,

 A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple

 Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.

 Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set

 The dogs o' th' street to bay me. Every villain

 Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus, and

 Be villainy less than 'twas! O Imogen!

 My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,

 Imogen, Imogen!

 IMOGEN. Peace, my lord. Hear, hear!

 POSTHUMUS. Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page, There lies thy part. [Strikes her. She falls] PISANIO. O gentlemen, help!

 Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!

 You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help!

 Mine honour'd lady!

 CYMBELINE. Does the world go round?

 POSTHUMUS. How comes these staggers on me?

 PISANIO. Wake, my mistress!

 CYMBELINE. If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me

 To death with mortal joy.

 PISANIO. How fares my mistress?

 IMOGEN. O, get thee from my sight;

 Thou gav'st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence!

 Breathe not where princes are.

 CYMBELINE. The tune of Imogen!

 PISANIO. Lady,

 The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if

 That box I gave you was not thought by me

 A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.

 CYMBELINE. New matter still?

 IMOGEN. It poison'd me.

 CORNELIUS. O gods!

 I left out one thing which the Queen confess'd,

 Which must approve thee honest. 'If Pisanio

 Have' said she 'given his mistress that confection

 Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv'd

 As I would serve a rat.'

 CYMBELINE. What's this, Cornelius?

 CORNELIUS. The Queen, sir, very oft importun'd me

 To temper poisons for her; still pretending

 The satisfaction of her knowledge only

 In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,

 Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose

 Was of more danger, did compound for her

 A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease

 The present pow'r of life, but in short time

 All offices of nature should again

 Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?

 IMOGEN. Most like I did, for I was dead.

 BELARIUS. My boys,

 There was our error.

 GUIDERIUS. This is sure Fidele.

 IMOGEN. Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?

 Think that you are upon a rock, and now

 Throw me again. [Embracing him] POSTHUMUS. Hang there like fruit, my soul,

 Till the tree die!

 CYMBELINE. How now, my flesh? my child?

 What, mak'st thou me a dullard in this act?

 Wilt thou not speak to me?

 IMOGEN. [Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.

 BELARIUS. [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love this

 youth, I blame ye not;

 You had a motive for't.

 CYMBELINE. My tears that fall

 Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,

 Thy mother's dead.

 IMOGEN. I am sorry for't, my lord.

 CYMBELINE. O, she was naught, and long of her it was

 That we meet here so strangely; but her son

 Is gone, we know not how nor where.

 PISANIO. My lord,

 Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,

 Upon my lady's missing, came to me

 With his sword drawn, foam'd at the mouth, and swore,

 If I discover'd not which way she was gone,

 It was my instant death. By accident

 I had a feigned letter of my master's

 Then in my pocket, which directed him

 To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;

 Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,

 Which he enforc'd from me, away he posts

 With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate

 My lady's honour. What became of him

 I further know not.

 GUIDERIUS. Let me end the story:

 I slew him there.

 CYMBELINE. Marry, the gods forfend!

 I would not thy good deeds should from my lips

 Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,

 Deny't again.

 GUIDERIUS. I have spoke it, and I did it.

 CYMBELINE. He was a prince.

 GUIDERIUS. A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me

 Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me

 With language that would make me spurn the sea,

 If it could so roar to me. I cut off's head,

 And am right glad he is not standing here

 To tell this tale of mine.

 CYMBELINE. I am sorry for thee.

 By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must

 Endure our law. Thou'rt dead.

 IMOGEN. That headless man

 I thought had been my lord.

 CYMBELINE. Bind the offender,

 And take him from our presence.

 BELARIUS. Stay, sir King.

 This man is better than the man he slew,

 As well descended as thyself, and hath

 More of thee merited than a band of Clotens

 Had ever scar for. [To the guard] Let his arms alone;

 They were not born for bondage.

 CYMBELINE. Why, old soldier,

 Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for

 By tasting of our wrath? How of descent

 As good as we?

 ARVIRAGUS. In that he spake too far.

 CYMBELINE. And thou shalt die for't.

 BELARIUS. We will die all three;

 But I will prove that two on's are as good

 As I have given out him. My sons, I must

 For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,

 Though haply well for you.

 ARVIRAGUS. Your danger's ours.

 GUIDERIUS. And our good his.

 BELARIUS. Have at it then by leave!

 Thou hadst, great King, a subject who

 Was call'd Belarius.

 CYMBELINE. What of him? He is

 A banish'd traitor.

 BELARIUS. He it is that hath

 Assum'd this age; indeed a banish'd man;

 I know not how a traitor.

 CYMBELINE. Take him hence,

 The whole world shall not save him.

 BELARIUS. Not too hot.

 First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,

 And let it be confiscate all, so soon

 As I have receiv'd it.

 CYMBELINE. Nursing of my sons?

 BELARIUS. I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee.

 Ere I arise I will prefer my sons;

 Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,

 These two young gentlemen that call me father,

 And think they are my sons, are none of mine;

 They are the issue of your loins, my liege,

 And blood of your begetting.

 CYMBELINE. How? my issue?

 BELARIUS. So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,

 Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd.

 Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment

 Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd

 Was all the harm I did. These gentle princesFor

 such and so they are- these twenty years

 Have I train'd up; those arts they have as

 Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as

 Your Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,

 Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children

 Upon my banishment; I mov'd her to't,

 Having receiv'd the punishment before

 For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty

 Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,

 The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shap'd

 Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,

 Here are your sons again, and I must lose

 Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.

 The benediction of these covering heavens

 Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy

 To inlay heaven with stars.

 CYMBELINE. Thou weep'st and speak'st.

 The service that you three have done is more

 Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children.

 If these be they, I know not how to wish

 A pair of worthier sons.

 BELARIUS. Be pleas'd awhile.

 This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,

 Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;

 This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,

 Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd

 In a most curious mantle, wrought by th' hand

 Of his queen mother, which for more probation

 I can with ease produce.

 CYMBELINE. Guiderius had

 Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;

 It was a mark of wonder.

 BELARIUS. This is he,

 Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.

 It was wise nature's end in the donation,

 To be his evidence now.

 CYMBELINE. O, what am I?

 A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother

 Rejoic'd deliverance more. Blest pray you be,

 That, after this strange starting from your orbs,

 You may reign in them now! O Imogen,

 Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

 IMOGEN. No, my lord;

 I have got two worlds by't. O my gentle brothers,

 Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter

 But I am truest speaker! You call'd me brother,

 When I was but your sister: I you brothers,

 When we were so indeed.

 CYMBELINE. Did you e'er meet?

 ARVIRAGUS. Ay, my good lord.

 GUIDERIUS. And at first meeting lov'd,

 Continu'd so until we thought he died.

 CORNELIUS. By the Queen's dram she swallow'd.

 CYMBELINE. O rare instinct!

 When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment

 Hath to it circumstantial branches, which

 Distinction should be rich in. Where? how liv'd you?

 And when came you to serve our Roman captive?

 How parted with your brothers? how first met them?

 Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,

 And your three motives to the battle, with

 I know not how much more, should be demanded,

 And all the other by-dependences,

 From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place

 Will serve our long interrogatories. See,

 Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;

 And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye

 On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting

 Each object with a joy; the counterchange

 Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,

 And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.

 [To BELARIUS] Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever. IMOGEN. You are my father too, and did relieve me

 To see this gracious season.

 CYMBELINE. All o'erjoy'd

 Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,

 For they shall taste our comfort.

 IMOGEN. My good master,

 I will yet do you service.

 LUCIUS. Happy be you!

 CYMBELINE. The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,

 He would have well becom'd this place and grac'd

 The thankings of a king.

 POSTHUMUS. I am, sir,

 The soldier that did company these three

 In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for

 The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,

 Speak, Iachimo. I had you down, and might

 Have made you finish.

 IACHIMO. [Kneeling] I am down again;

 But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,

 As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,

 Which I so often owe; but your ring first,

 And here the bracelet of the truest princess

 That ever swore her faith.

 POSTHUMUS. Kneel not to me.

 The pow'r that I have on you is to spare you;

 The malice towards you to forgive you. Live,

 And deal with others better.

 CYMBELINE. Nobly doom'd!

 We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;

 Pardon's the word to all.

 ARVIRAGUS. You holp us, sir,

 As you did mean indeed to be our brother;

 Joy'd are we that you are.

 POSTHUMUS. Your servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,

 Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought

 Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,

 Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows

 Of mine own kindred. When I wak'd, I found

 This label on my bosom; whose containing

 Is so from sense in hardness that I can

 Make no collection of it. Let him show

 His skill in the construction.

 LUCIUS. Philarmonus!

 SOOTHSAYER. Here, my good lord.

 LUCIUS. Read, and declare the meaning.

 SOOTHSAYER. [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embrac'd by

 a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches which, being dead many years, shall

 after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'

 Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;

 The fit and apt construction of thy name,

 Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.

 [To CYMBELINE] The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter, Which we call 'mollis aer,' and 'mollis aer'

 We term it 'mulier'; which 'mulier' I divine

 Is this most constant wife, who even now

 Answering the letter of the oracle,

 Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about

 With this most tender air.

 CYMBELINE. This hath some seeming.

 SOOTHSAYER. The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,

 Personates thee; and thy lopp'd branches point

 Thy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol'n,

 For many years thought dead, are now reviv'd,

 To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue

 Promises Britain peace and plenty.

 CYMBELINE. Well,

 My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,

 Although the victor, we submit to Caesar

 And to the Roman empire, promising

 To pay our wonted tribute, from the which

 We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,

 Whom heavens in justice, both on her and hers,

 Have laid most heavy hand.

 SOOTHSAYER. The fingers of the pow'rs above do tune

 The harmony of this peace. The vision

 Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke

 Of yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant

 Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,

 From south to west on wing soaring aloft,

 Lessen'd herself and in the beams o' th' sun

 So vanish'd; which foreshow'd our princely eagle,

 Th'imperial Caesar, Caesar, should again unite

 His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,

 Which shines here in the west.

 CYMBELINE. Laud we the gods;

 And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils

 From our bless'd altars. Publish we this peace

 To all our subjects. Set we forward; let

 A Roman and a British ensign wave

 Friendly together. So through Lud's Town march;

 And in the temple of great Jupiter

 Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.

 Set on there! Never was a war did cease,

 Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace. Exeunt

 SCENE.- Elsinore.

 ACT I. Scene I.

 Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

 Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

 Ber. Who's there.?

 Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.

 Ber. Long live the King!

 Fran. Bernardo?

 Ber. He.

 Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.

 Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.

 Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,

 And I am sick at heart.

 Ber. Have you had quiet guard?

 Fran. Not a mouse stirring.

 Ber. Well, good night.

 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

 The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

 Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

 Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?

 Hor. Friends to this ground.

 Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.

 Fran. Give you good night.

 Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.

 Who hath reliev'd you?

 Fran. Bernardo hath my place.

 Give you good night. Exit. Mar. Holla, Bernardo!

 Ber. SayWhat,

 is Horatio there ?

 Hor. A piece of him.

 Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

 Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

 Ber. I have seen nothing.

 Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

 And will not let belief take hold of him

 Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.

 Therefore I have entreated him along,

 With us to watch the minutes of this night,

 That, if again this apparition come,

 He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

 Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

 Ber. Sit down awhile,

 And let us once again assail your ears,

 That are so fortified against our story,

 What we two nights have seen.

 Hor. Well, sit we down,

 And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

 Ber. Last night of all,

 When yond same star that's westward from the pole

 Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven

 Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,

 The bell then beating one-

 Enter Ghost.

 Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!

 Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.

 Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

 Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.

 Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.

 Ber. It would be spoke to.

 Mar. Question it, Horatio.

 Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night

 Together with that fair and warlike form

 In which the majesty of buried Denmark

 Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!

 Mar. It is offended.

 Ber. See, it stalks away!

 Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!

 Exit Ghost. Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.

 Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.

 Is not this something more than fantasy?

 What think you on't?

 Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe

 Without the sensible and true avouch

 Of mine own eyes.

 Mar. Is it not like the King?

 Hor. As thou art to thyself.

 Such was the very armour he had on

 When he th' ambitious Norway combated.

 So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,

 He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.

 'Tis strange.

 Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,

 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

 Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;

 But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,

 This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

 Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,

 Why this same strict and most observant watch

 So nightly toils the subject of the land,

 And why such daily cast of brazen cannon

 And foreign mart for implements of war;

 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task

 Does not divide the Sunday from the week.

 What might be toward, that this sweaty haste

 Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?

 Who is't that can inform me?

 Hor. That can I.

 At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,

 Whose image even but now appear'd to us,

 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,

 Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,

 Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet

 (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)

 Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,

 Well ratified by law and heraldry,

 Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands

 Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;

 Against the which a moiety competent

 Was gaged by our king; which had return'd

 To the inheritance of Fortinbras,

 Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart

 And carriage of the article design'd,

 His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

 Of unimproved mettle hot and full,

 Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,

 Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,

 For food and diet, to some enterprise

 That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,

 As it doth well appear unto our state,

 But to recover of us, by strong hand

 And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands

 So by his father lost; and this, I take it,

 Is the main motive of our preparations,

 The source of this our watch, and the chief head

 Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

 Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.

 Well may it sort that this portentous figure

 Comes armed through our watch, so like the King

 That was and is the question of these wars.

 Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.

 In the most high and palmy state of Rome,

 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,

 The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead

 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;

 As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,

 Disasters in the sun; and the moist star

 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands

 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.

 And even the like precurse of fierce events,

 As harbingers preceding still the fates

 And prologue to the omen coming on,

 Have heaven and earth together demonstrated

 Unto our climature and countrymen.

 Enter Ghost again.

 But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!

 I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!

 Spreads his arms. If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,

 Speak to me.

 If there be any good thing to be done,

 That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,

 Speak to me.

 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,

 Which happily foreknowing may avoid,

 O, speak!

 Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life

 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth

 (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),

 The cock crows. Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!

 Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

 Hor. Do, if it will not stand.

 Ber. 'Tis here!

 Hor. 'Tis here!

 Mar. 'Tis gone!

 Exit Ghost. We do it wrong, being so majestical,

 To offer it the show of violence;

 For it is as the air, invulnerable,

 And our vain blows malicious mockery.

 Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

 Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing

 Upon a fearful summons. I have heard

 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,

 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat

 Awake the god of day; and at his warning,

 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

 Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies

 To his confine; and of the truth herein

 This present object made probation.

 Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.

 Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes

 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,

 The bird of dawning singeth all night long;

 And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,

 The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,

 No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,

 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

 Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.

 But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,

 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.

 Break we our watch up; and by my advice

 Let us impart what we have seen to-night

 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,

 This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.

 Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,

 As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know

 Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.

 Scene II.

 Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

 Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,] Lords Attendant.

 King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

 The memory be green, and that it us befitted

 To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom

 To be contracted in one brow of woe,

 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

 That we with wisest sorrow think on him

 Together with remembrance of ourselves.

 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,

 Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,

 Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,

 With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,

 With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,

 In equal scale weighing delight and dole,

 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd

 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone

 With this affair along. For all, our thanks.

 Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,

 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,

 Or thinking by our late dear brother's death

 Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,

 Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,

 He hath not fail'd to pester us with message

 Importing the surrender of those lands

 Lost by his father, with all bands of law,

 To our most valiant brother. So much for him.

 Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.

 Thus much the business is: we have here writ

 To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,

 Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears

 Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress

 His further gait herein, in that the levies,

 The lists, and full proportions are all made

 Out of his subject; and we here dispatch

 You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,

 For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,

 Giving to you no further personal power

 To business with the King, more than the scope

 Of these dilated articles allow. [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

 Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty. King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.

 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius. And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?

 You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?

 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane

 And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,

 That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?

 The head is not more native to the heart,

 The hand more instrumental to the mouth,

 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.

 What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

 Laer. My dread lord,

 Your leave and favour to return to France;

 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark

 To show my duty in your coronation,

 Yet now I must confess, that duty done,

 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France

 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

 King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

 Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave

 By laboursome petition, and at last

 Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.

 I do beseech you give him leave to go.

 King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,

 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!

 But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my sonHam.

 [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!

 King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

 Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.

 Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,

 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.

 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids

 Seek for thy noble father in the dust.

 Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,

 Passing through nature to eternity.

 Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.

 Queen. If it be,

 Why seems it so particular with thee?

 Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'

 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

 Nor customary suits of solemn black,

 Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,

 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,

 Nor the dejected havior of the visage,

 Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,

 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,

 For they are actions that a man might play;

 But I have that within which passeth showThese

 but the trappings and the suits of woe.

 King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,

 To give these mourning duties to your father;

 But you must know, your father lost a father;

 That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound

 In filial obligation for some term

 To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever

 In obstinate condolement is a course

 Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;

 It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,

 A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,

 An understanding simple and unschool'd;

 For what we know must be, and is as common

 As any the most vulgar thing to sense,

 Why should we in our peevish opposition

 Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,

 A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,

 To reason most absurd, whose common theme

 Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,

 From the first corse till he that died to-day,

 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth

 This unprevailing woe, and think of us

 As of a father; for let the world take note

 You are the most immediate to our throne,

 And with no less nobility of love

 Than that which dearest father bears his son

 Do I impart toward you. For your intent

 In going back to school in Wittenberg,

 It is most retrograde to our desire;

 And we beseech you, bend you to remain

 Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

 Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

 Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.

 I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.

 Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

 King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.

 Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.

 This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet

 Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,

 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day

 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,

 And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,

 Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.

 Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet. Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,

 Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!

 Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd

 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!

 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable

 Seem to me all the uses of this world!

 Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden

 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature

 Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

 But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.

 So excellent a king, that was to this

 Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother

 That he might not beteem the winds of heaven

 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!

 Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him

 As if increase of appetite had grown

 By what it fed on; and yet, within a monthLet

 me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-

 A little month, or ere those shoes were old

 With which she followed my poor father's body

 Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she

 (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason

 Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;

 My father's brother, but no more like my father

 Than I to Hercules. Within a month,

 Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

 Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,

 She married. O, most wicked speed, to post

 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

 It is not, nor it cannot come to good.

 But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

 Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

 Hor. Hail to your lordship!

 Ham. I am glad to see you well.

 Horatio!- or I do forget myself.

 Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

 Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you. And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?

 Marcellus?

 Mar. My good lord!

 Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.- But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

 Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.

 Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,

 Nor shall you do my ear that violence

 To make it truster of your own report

 Against yourself. I know you are no truant.

 But what is your affair in Elsinore?

 We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

 Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

 Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.

 I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

 Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

 Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats

 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

 Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

 Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

 My father- methinks I see my father.

 Hor. O, where, my lord?

 Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.

 Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.

 Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.

 I shall not look upon his like again.

 Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

 Ham. Saw? who?

 Hor. My lord, the King your father.

 Ham. The King my father?

 Hor. Season your admiration for a while

 With an attent ear, till I may deliver

 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,

 This marvel to you.

 Ham. For God's love let me hear!

 Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen

 (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch

 In the dead vast and middle of the night

 Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,

 Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,

 Appears before them and with solemn march

 Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd

 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,

 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd

 Almost to jelly with the act of fear,

 Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me

 In dreadful secrecy impart they did,

 And I with them the third night kept the watch;

 Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,

 Form of the thing, each word made true and good,

 The apparition comes. I knew your father.

 These hands are not more like.

 Ham. But where was this?

 Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

 Ham. Did you not speak to it?

 Hor. My lord, I did;

 But answer made it none. Yet once methought

 It lifted up it head and did address

 Itself to motion, like as it would speak;

 But even then the morning cock crew loud,

 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away

 And vanish'd from our sight.

 Ham. 'Tis very strange.

 Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;

 And we did think it writ down in our duty

 To let you know of it.

 Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.

 Hold you the watch to-night?

 Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.

 Ham. Arm'd, say you?

 Both. Arm'd, my lord.

 Ham. From top to toe?

 Both. My lord, from head to foot.

 Ham. Then saw you not his face?

 Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.

 Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.

 Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

 Ham. Pale or red?

 Hor. Nay, very pale.

 Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?

 Hor. Most constantly.

 Ham. I would I had been there.

 Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.

 Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

 Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

 Both. Longer, longer.

 Hor. Not when I saw't.

 Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?

 Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,

 A sable silver'd.

 Ham. I will watch to-night.

 Perchance 'twill walk again.

 Hor. I warr'nt it will.

 Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,

 I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape

 And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,

 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,

 Let it be tenable in your silence still;

 And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,

 Give it an understanding but no tongue.

 I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.

 Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,

 I'll visit you.

 All. Our duty to your honour.

 Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

 Exeunt [all but Hamlet]. My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.

 I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!

 Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,

 Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

 Exit.

 Scene III.

 Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

 Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

 Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.

 And, sister, as the winds give benefit

 And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,

 But let me hear from you.

 Oph. Do you doubt that?

 Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,

 Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;

 A violet in the youth of primy nature,

 Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;

 The perfume and suppliance of a minute;

 No more.

 Oph. No more but so?

 Laer. Think it no more.

 For nature crescent does not grow alone

 In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,

 The inward service of the mind and soul

 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,

 And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch

 The virtue of his will; but you must fear,

 His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;

 For he himself is subject to his birth.

 He may not, as unvalued persons do,

 Carve for himself, for on his choice depends

 The safety and health of this whole state,

 And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd

 Unto the voice and yielding of that body

 Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,

 It fits your wisdom so far to believe it

 As he in his particular act and place

 May give his saying deed; which is no further

 Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain

 If with too credent ear you list his songs,

 Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open

 To his unmast'red importunity.

 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,

 And keep you in the rear of your affection,

 Out of the shot and danger of desire.

 The chariest maid is prodigal enough

 If she unmask her beauty to the moon.

 Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.

 The canker galls the infants of the spring

 Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,

 And in the morn and liquid dew of youth

 Contagious blastments are most imminent.

 Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.

 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

 Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep

 As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,

 Do not as some ungracious pastors do,

 Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,

 Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,

 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads

 And recks not his own rede.

 Laer. O, fear me not!

 Enter Polonius.

 I stay too long. But here my father comes.

 A double blessing is a double grace;

 Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

 Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!

 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,

 And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!

 And these few precepts in thy memory

 Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,

 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.

 Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:

 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,

 Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;

 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment

 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware

 Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,

 Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.

 Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;

 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;

 For the apparel oft proclaims the man,

 And they in France of the best rank and station

 Are most select and generous, chief in that.

 Neither a borrower nor a lender be;

 For loan oft loses both itself and friend,

 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

 This above all- to thine own self be true,

 And it must follow, as the night the day,
